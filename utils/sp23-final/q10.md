Costin, a San Francisco native, will be back in San Francisco over the
summer, and is curious as to whether it is true that about $\frac{3}{4}$
of days in San Francisco are sunny.

Fast forward to the end of September: Costin counted that of the 30 days
in September, 27 were sunny in San Francisco. To test his theory, Costin
came up with two pairs of hypotheses.

Pair 1:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **not** $\frac{3}{4}$.

Pair 2:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **greater than**
    $\frac{3}{4}$.

For each test statistic below, choose whether the test statistic could
be used to test Pair 1, Pair 2, both, or neither. Assume that all days
are either sunny or cloudy, and that we cannot perform two-tailed
hypothesis tests. (If you don't know what those are, you don't need to!)
