\noindent \textbf{Welcome to the Final Exam for DSC 10 in Spring 2023!}

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent You may have noticed that San Diego was quite cloudy in May. In fact, according to the National Weather Service, San Diego was the single cloudiest city in the contiguous United States in May, with clouds covering the sky 82\% of the time. (Only a remote town in Alaska was cloudier!)

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent In this exam, we will work with the DataFrame \texttt{sun}, which describes the number of sunshine hours per month in various cities around the world. Each number in \texttt{sun} is an average across multiple years and multiple sensors.

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent The first 2 columns in \texttt{sun} are \texttt{"Country"} and \texttt{"City"}, which are strings describing a particular city. The next 12 columns are \texttt{"Jan"}, \texttt{"Feb"}, \texttt{"Mar"}, ..., \texttt{"Dec"}, which describe the number of sunshine hours seen each month. The last column, \texttt{"Year"}, is the sum of the month-specific columns.

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent The first few rows of \texttt{sun} are shown below, though \texttt{sun} has many more rows than are shown below.

\end{center}

\noindent For instance, we see that Tashkent, Uzbekistan sees 164.3 sunshine hours in March.

\vspace{.1in}

\noindent \textbf{Throughout the exam}, assume that we have already run \texttt{import babypandas as bpd} and \texttt{import numpy as np}.

\vspace{.5in}

\noindent \textbf{Advice: Read through all of the questions on the exam first before starting. The questions are not sorted by difficulty!}
