According to Indeed, a popular job website, the hourly pay for data
science interns across the US has a mean of 24 and a standard deviation
of 6. You take a random sample of 64 data science interns. In your
sample, the hourly pay has a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4.
Suppose you bootstrap your sample 10,000 times, calculate the mean
hourly pay from each resample, and plot a histogram of these resampled
means. Which of the following best describes this histogram?

( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 24 and a standard deviation of 0.75.

( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4.

( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 0.5.
