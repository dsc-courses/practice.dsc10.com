You are interested in estimating the average wait time between an
interview and an internship offer being made. You take a random sample
of $n$ internship offers and find that in this sample, the average wait
time is $d$ days and the standard deviation is 4 days.

You construct a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the true average
wait time, in days, which comes out to $[10.4, 13.6]$. Find $n$ and $d$.
