<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life span?</p>
<p>It would be unethical to try to run a randomized controlled experiment to address the question of whether drug abuse leads to a shorter life span, as this would involve splitting participants into groups and telling one group to abuse drugs. This is problematic because we know drug abuse brings about a host of problems, so we could not ethically ask people to harm themselves.</p>
<p>Notice that the first proposed study, about the impacts of citrus fruits on heart disease, does not involve the same kind of ethical dilemma because we’re not forcing people to do something known to be harmful. A randomized controlled experiment would involve splitting participants into two groups and asking one group to eat citrus fruits, and measuring the heart health of both groups. Since there are no known harmful effects of eating citrus fruits, there is no ethical issue.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could run a randomized controlled trial by giving an exam where some students had to sign an integrity pledge and others didn’t, tracking the number of reported dishonesty cases in each group. Likewise, we could reward some students for good grades and not others, and keep track of high school graduation rates in each group. Neither of these studies would involve knowingly harming people and could reasonably be carried out.</p>

<p>You are given a DataFrame called <code>sports</code>, indexed by <code>'Sport'</code> containing one column, <code>'PlayersPerTeam'</code>. The first few rows of the DataFrame are shown below:</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>sports.index[1]</code></p>
<p>We are told that the DataFrame is indexed by <code>'Sport'</code> and <code>'basketball'</code> is one of the elements of the index. To access an element of the index, we use <code>.index</code> to extract the index and square brackets to extract an element at a certain position. Therefore, <code>sports.index[1]</code> will evaluate to <code>'basketball'</code>..</p>
<p>The first two answer choices attempt to use <code>.loc</code> or <code>.iloc</code> directly on a DataFrame. We typically use <code>.loc</code> or <code>.iloc</code> on a Series that results from using <code>.get</code> on some column. Although we don’t typically do it this way, it is possible to use <code>.loc</code> or <code>.iloc</code> directly on a DataFrame, but doing so would produce an entire row of the DataFrame. Since we want just one word, <code>'basketball'</code>, the first two answer choices must be incorrect.</p>
<p>The last answer choice is incorrect because we can’t use <code>.get</code> with the index, only with a column. The index is never considered a column.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h2>
<p>The following is a quote from The New York Times’ <em>The Morning</em> newsletter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me this weekend: “I don’t actually care about infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term complications.”</p>
<p>By those measures, all five of the vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has done so far to <strong>a representative group of 75,000 American adults</strong>: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero and nearly zero, based on the research trials.</p>
<p>Zero isn’t even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and hospitalizes more than 100 of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does the article use <em>a representative group of 75,000 American adults</em>?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Convention. Rates are often given per 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comprehension. Readers should have a sense of the scale of 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Arbitrary. There is no particular reason to use a group of this size.</p></li>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the article is to compare Covid outcomes among two groups of people: the 75,000 people who got the vaccine in a research trial and a representative group of 75,000 American adults. Since 75,000 people got the vaccine in a research trial, we need to compare statistics like number of deaths and hospitalizations to another group of the same size for the comparison to be meaningful.</p>
<p>There is no convention about using 75,000 for rates. This number is used because that’s how many people got the vaccine in a research trial. If a different number of people had been vaccinated in a research trial, the article would have taken that number of adults in their representative comparison group.</p>
<p>75,000 is quite a large number and most people probably don’t have a sense of the scale of 75,000 people. If the goal were comprehension, it would have made more sense to use a smaller number like 100 people.</p>
<p>The number 75,000 is not arbitrary. It was chosen as the size of the representative group specifically to match the size of the group of people who the vaccine in a research trial.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h2>
<p>Suppose you are given a DataFrame of employees for a given company. The DataFrame, called <code>employees</code>, is indexed by <code>'employee_id'</code> (string) with a column called <code>'years'</code> (int) that contains the number of years each employee has worked for the company.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.1">Problem 4.1</h3>
<p>Suppose that the code <code>employees.sort_values(by='years', ascending=False).index[0]</code> outputs <code>'2476'</code>.</p>
<p>True or False: The number of years that employee 2476 has worked for the company is greater than the number of years that any other employee has worked for the company.</p>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> False</p>
<p>This is false because there could be other employees who worked at the company equally long as employee 2476.</p>
<p>The code says that when the <code>employees</code> DataFrame is sorted in descending order of <code>'years'</code>, employee 2476 is in the first row. There might, however, be a tie among several employees for their value of <code>'years'</code>. In that case, employee 2476 may wind up in the first row of the sorted DataFrame, but we cannot say that the number of years employee 2476 has worked for the company is greater than the number of years that any other employee has worked for the company.</p>
<p>If the statement had said <em>greater than or equal to</em> instead of <em>greater than</em>, the statement would have been true</p>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> an error message complaining about something else</p>
<p>The problem is that the first line of code does not actually add a new column to the <code>employees</code> DataFrame because the expression is not saved. So the second line tries to sort by a column, <code>'start'</code>, that doesn’t exist in the <code>employees</code> DataFrame and runs into an error when it can’t find a column by that name.</p>
<p>This code also has a problem with <code>iloc[-1]</code>, since <code>iloc</code> cannot be used on the index, but since the problem with the missing <code>'start'</code> column is encountered first, that will be the error message displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> True</p>
<p>The brackets in <code>df[b]</code> perform a query, or filter, to keep only the rows of <code>df</code> for which <code>b</code> has a <code>True</code> entry. Typically, <code>b</code> will come from some condition, such as the entry in a certain column of <code>df</code> equalling a certain value. Regardless, <code>df[b]</code> contains a subset of the rows of <code>df</code>, and <code>.shape[0]</code> counts the number of rows, so <code>df[b].shape[0]</code> must be less than or equal to `df.shape[0].</p>
