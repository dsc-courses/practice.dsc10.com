<p>Welcome to Sun God!</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/cartoon.png' width=20%></center>
<p>After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, UCSD’s annual music
festival, the Sun God festival, is back this year! In this exam, we’ll
be looking at a DataFrame named <code>sungod</code> that contains
information on the artists who have performed at Sun God in years past.
<strong>For each year that the festival was held, we have one row for
each artist that performed that year.</strong> The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'Year'</code> (<code>int</code>): the year of the
festival</li>
<li><code>'Artist'</code> (<code>str</code>): the name of the
artist</li>
<li><code>'Appearance_Order'</code> (<code>int</code>): the order in
which the artist appeared in that year’s festival (1 means they came
onstage first)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rows of <code>sungod</code> are arranged in <strong>no particular
order</strong>. The first few rows of <code>sungod</code> are shown
below (though <code>sungod</code> has <strong>many more rows</strong>
than pictured here).</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/sungod.png' width=30%></center>
<p>Assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one artist ever appeared at a time (for example, we can’t have
two separate artists with a <code>'Year'</code> of 2015 and an
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code> of 3).</li>
<li>An artist may appear in multiple different Sun God festivals (they
could be invited back).</li>
<li>We have already run <code>import babypandas as bpd</code> and
<code>import numpy as np</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Throughout this exam, we will refer to <code>sungod</code>
repeatedly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Open this page in another tab, so that it is
easy to refer to this data description as you work through the exam.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Two different artists have the same name.,
An artist performed at Sun God in more than one year.</p>
<p>For this question, it is crucial to know that an index should not
contain duplicate values, so we need to consider reasons why
<code>'Artist'</code> might contain two values that are the same. Let’s
go through the answer choices in order.</p>
<p>For the first option, if two different artists had the same name,
this would lead to duplicate values in the <code>'Artist'</code> column.
Therefore, this is a valid reson not to index <code>sungod</code> by
<code>'Artist'</code>.</p>
<p>For the second option, if one artist performed at Sun God in more
than one year, their name would appear multiple times in the
<code>'Artist'</code> column, once for each year they performed. This
would also be a valid reason not to index <code>sungod</code> by
<code>'Artist'</code>.</p>
<p>For the third option, if several different artists performed at Sun
God in the same year, that would not necessarily create duplicates in
the <code>'Artist'</code> column, unless of course two of the artists
had the same name, which we’ve already addressed in the first answer
choice. This is not a valid reason to avoid indexing <code>sungod</code>
by <code>'Artist'</code>.</p>
<p>For the last answer choice, if many different artists share the same
value of <code>'Appearance_Order'</code>, this would not create
duplicates in the <code>'Artist'</code> column. Therefore, this is also
not a valid reason to avoid indexing <code>sungod</code> by
<code>'Artist'</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<center><img src="../assets/images/sp22-midterm/graph-paper-soln.png" width="330"/></center>
<p>To draw the histogram, we first need to bin the data and figure out
how many data values fall into each bin. The code includes
<code>bins=np.arange(0, 7, 2)</code> which means the bin endpoints are
<span class="math inline">0, 2, 4, 6</span>. This gives us three bins:
<span class="math inline">[0, 2)</span>, <span class="math inline">[2,
4)</span>, and <span class="math inline">[4, 6]</span>. Remember that
all bins, except for the last one, include the left endpoint but not the
right. The last bin includes both endpoints.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the bins are, we can count up the number of
values in each bin. We need to look at the
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code> column of
<code>sungod.take(np.arange(5))</code>, or the first five rows of
<code>sungod</code>. The values there are <span class="math inline">1,
4, 3, 1, 3</span>. The two <span class="math inline">1</span>s fall into
the first bin <span class="math inline">[0, 2)</span>. The two <span class="math inline">3</span>s fall into the second bin <span class="math inline">[2, 4)</span>, and the one <span class="math inline">4</span> falls into the last bin <span class="math inline">[4, 6]</span>. This means the proportion of values
in each bin are <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}, \frac{2}{5},
\frac{1}{5}</span> from left to right.</p>
<p>To figure out the height of each bar in the histogram, we use the
fact that the area of a bar in a density histogram should equal the
proportion of values in that bin. The area of a rectangle is height
times width, so height is area divided by width.</p>
<p>For the bin <span class="math inline">[0, 2)</span>, the area is
<span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5} = 0.4</span> and the width is
<span class="math inline">2</span>, so the height is <span class="math inline">\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2</span>.</p>
<p>For the bin <span class="math inline">[2, 4)</span>, the area is
<span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5} = 0.4</span> and the width is
<span class="math inline">2</span>, so the height is <span class="math inline">\frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2</span>.</p>
<p>For the bin <span class="math inline">[4, 6]</span>, the area is
<span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5} = 0.2</span> and the width is
<span class="math inline">2</span>, so the height is <span class="math inline">\frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1</span>.</p>
<p>Since the bins are all the same width, the fact that there an equal
number of values in the first two bins and half as many in the third bin
means the first two bars should be equally tall and the third should be
half as tall. We can use this to draw the rest of the histogram quickly
once we’ve drawn the first bar.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>'Blues Traveler'</code></p>
<p>In the first cell, although we seem to be sorting <code>sungod</code>
by <code>'Year'</code>, we aren’t actually changing the DataFrame
<code>sungod</code> at all because we don’t save the sorted DataFrame.
Remember that DataFrame methods don’t actually change the underlying
DataFrame unless you explicitly make that happen by saving the output as
the name of the DataFrame. So the first <code>'Artist'</code> name will
still be <code>'Blues Traveler'</code>.</p>
<p>Suppose we had saved the sorted DataFrame as in the code below.</p>
<div id="cb1" class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>    sungod <span class="op">=</span> sungod.sort_values(by<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">'Year'</span>)   </span>

</div>
<p>In this case, the output would be the name of an artist who appeared
in 1983, but not necessarily the one who appeared first. There will be
several artists associated with the year 1983, and we don’t know which
of them will be first in the sorted DataFrame.</p>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
<code>sungod.groupby('Year').count().get('Artist').max()</code>,
<code>sungod.get('Appearance_Order').max()</code></p>
<p>Let’s go through all the answer choices.</p>
<p>For the first option,
<code>sungod.groupby('Appearance_Order').count()</code> will create a
DataFrame with one row for each unique value of
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code>, and each column will contain the same
value, which represents the number of Sun God festivals that had at
least a certain amount of performers. For example, the first row of
<code>sungod.groupby('Appearance_Order').count()</code> will correspond
to an <code>'Appearance_Order'</code> of 1, and each column will contain
a count of the number of Sun God festivals with at least one performer.
Since every festival has at least one performer, the largest count in
any column, including <code>'Year'</code> will be in this first row. So
<code>sungod.groupby('Appearance_Order').count().get('Year').max()</code>
represents the total number of Sun God festivals, which is not the
quantity we’re trying to find.</p>
<p>For the second option, <code>sungod.groupby('Year').count()</code>
will create a DataFrame with one row per year, with each column
containing a count of the number of artists that performed in that
year’s festival. If we take the largest such count in any one column, we
are finding the largest number of artists that ever performed in a
single Sun God festival. Therefore,
<code>sungod.groupby('Year').count().get('Artist').max()</code> is
correct.</p>
<p>The third option works because we can find the desired quantity by
simply looking for the largest value in the
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code> column. For example, if the largest
number of artists to ever perform in a Sun God festival was, say, 17,
then for that year’s festival, the last artist to appear would have a
value of 17 in the <code>'Appearance_Order'</code> column. There can be
no 18 anywhere in the <code>'Appearance_Order'</code> column, otherwise
that would mean there was some festival with 18 performers. Therefore,
<code>sungod.get('Appearance_Order').max()</code> is correct.</p>
<p>The fourth option is not even correct Python code. The DataFrame
produced by <code>sungod.groupby('Year').max()</code> is indexed by
<code>'Year'</code> and no longer has <code>'Year'</code> as a column.
So we’d get an error if we tried to access this nonexistent column, as

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
<code>['Year', 'Appearance_Order']</code></p>
<p>The fact that <code>groupby</code> automatically sorts the index in
ascending order is important here. Since we want earlier years before
later years, we could group by <code>'Year'</code>, however if we
<em>just</em> group by year, all the artists who performed in a given
year will be aggregated together, which is not what we want. Within each
year, we want to organize the artists in ascending order of
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code>. In other words, we need to group by
<code>'Year'</code> with <code>'Appearance_Order'</code> as subgroups.
Therefore, the correct way to reorder the rows of <code>sungod</code> as
desired is
<code>sungod.groupby(['Year', 'Appearance_Order']).max().reset_index()</code>.
Note that we need to reset the index so that the resulting DataFrame has
<code>'Year'</code> and <code>'Appearance_Order'</code> as columns, like
in <code>sungod</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
<code>merged = sungod.merge(music, left_on='Artist', right_on='Name')</code></p>
<p>The question we want to answer is about Sun God music artists’
genres. In order to answer, we’ll need a DataFrame consisting of rows of
artists that have performed at Sun God since its inception in 1983. If
we merge the <code>sungod</code> DataFrame with the <code>music</code>
DataFrame based on the artist’s name, we’ll end up with a DataFrame
containing one row for each artist that has ever performed at Sun God.
Since the column containing artists’ names is called
<code>'Artist'</code> in <code>sungod</code> and <code>'Name'</code> in
<code>music</code>, the correct syntax for this merge is
<code>merged = sungod.merge(music, left_on='Artist', right_on='Name')</code>.
Note that we could also interchange the left DataFrame with the right
DataFrame, as swapping the roles of the two DataFrames in a merge only
changes the ordering of rows and columns in the output, not the data
itself. This can be written in code as
<code>merged = music.merge(sungod, left_on='Name', right_on='Artist')</code>,
but this is not one of the answer choices.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>top_hit_year - year</code></p>
<p>Before we can answer this question, we need to understand what the
first three lines of the <code>classify_artist</code> function are
doing. The first line creates a DataFrame with only one row,
corresponding to the particular artist that’s passed in as input to the
function. We know there is just one row because we are told that the
artist being passed in as input has appeared exactly once at Sun God.
The next two lines create two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>year</code> contains the year in which the artist performed at
Sun God, and</li>
<li><code>top_hit_year</code> contains the year in which their top hit
song was released.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can fill in blank (a). Notice that the body of the
<code>if</code> clause is <code>return 'up-and-coming'</code>. Therefore
we need a condition that corresponds to up-and-coming, which we are told
means the top hit came out after the artist appeared at Sun God. Using
the variables that have been defined for us, this condition is
<code>top_hit_year &gt; year</code>. However, the <code>if</code>
statement condition is already partially set up with <code>&gt; 0</code>
included. We can simply rearrange our condition
<code>top_hit_year &gt; year</code> by subtracting <code>year</code>
from both sides to obtain <code>top_hit_year - year &gt; 0</code>, which
fits the desired format.</p>

<p>For this part, we need a condition that corresponds to an artist

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> northwest</p>
<p>The scatterplot shows an artist’s year of performance at Sun God on
the x-axis, and their top hit year on the y-axis.</p>
<p>Since Drake is considered trending, we know his top hit came out
within the five years prior to his Sun God performance. In other words,
the time gap between his top hit release and his Sun God performance is
at most five years.</p>
<p>If Michelle Branch were in the northwest quadrant, that would mean
her x-coordinate was smaller than Drake’s, and her y-coordinate was
larger. In other words, that would mean she performed at Sun God before
Drake and her top hit was released after Drake’s. This means the time
gap between her top hit release and her Sun God performance is less than
five years, so she could not be considered outdated.</p>
<p>We could also answer this question through process of elimination.
This would entail finding scenarios that show each of the other three
quadrants is possible.</p>
<p>Michelle Branch could wind up in the northeast quadrant if, say, she
performed 10 years after Drake and released her top hit 1 year after
Drake. She’d be considered outdated because the time gap between her top
hit and her Sun God performance would exceed five years.</p>
<p>Similarly, Michelle Branch could be in the southwest quadrant if,
say, she performed 1 year before Drake and released her top hit 10 years
before Drake. Again, the time gap between her top hit and her Sun God
performance would exceed five years, making her outdated.</p>
<p>She could also be in the southeast quadrant if, say, she performed 10
years after Drake and released her top hit 10 years before Drake. This
would also make the time gap between her top hit and Sun God performance
more than five years.</p>
<p>So since all three other quadrants are possible and we are told that
one quadrant is impossible, the northwest quadrant must be
impossible.</p>

<p>We know there is an association between administrative changes and

after the changes went into effect.</p>
<p>However, since no randomized controlled trial was done, we can’t be

maybe there were fewer hospitalizations because a new flavor of
sparkling water came out in 2014, and people drank that instead of
alcohol. We just don’t know enough to conclude any causal explanation

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>attending.sum() &gt; 20000</code></p>
<p>Let’s look at the variable <code>attending</code>. Since we’re
choosing 21,000 elements from the list <code>[True, False]</code> and
there are 21,000 tickets distributed, this code is randomly determining
whether each ticket holder will actually attend the festival. There’s a
95% chance of each ticket holder attending, which is reflected in the
<code>p=[0.95, 0.05]</code> argument. Remember that
<code>np.random.choice</code> returns an array of random choices, which
in this case means it will contain 21,000 elements, each of which is
<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>We want to figure out the probability of at least one ticket holder
showing up and not being admitted. Another way to say this is we want to
find the probability that more than 20,000 ticket holders show up to
attend the festival. The way we approximate a probability through
simulation is we repeat a process many times and see how often some
event occured. The event we’re interested in this case is that more than
20,000 ticket holders came to Sun God. Since we have an array of
<code>True</code> and <code>False</code> values corresponding to whether
each ticket holder actually came, we just need to determine if there are
more than 20,000 <code>True</code> values in the <code>attending</code>
array.</p>
<p>There are several ways to count the number of <code>True</code>
values in a Boolean array. One way is to sum the array since in Python
<code>True</code> counts as 1 and <code>False</code> counts as 0.
Therefore, <code>attending.sum() &gt; 20000</code> is the condition we
need to check here.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>num_angry = num_angry + 1</code></p>
<p>Remember our goal in simulation is to repeat a process many times to
see how often some event occurs. The repetition comes from the
<code>for</code> loop which runs 10,000 times. Each time, we are
simulating the process of 21,000 students each randomly deciding whether
to show up to Sun God or not. We want to know, out of these 10,000
trials, how frequently more than 20,000 of the students will show up. So
when this happens, we want to record that it happened. The standard way
to do that is to keep a counter variable that starts at 0 and gets
incremented, or increased by one, each time we had more than 20,000
attendees in our simulation.</p>
<p>The framework to do this is already set up because a variable called
<code>num_angry</code> is initialized to 0 before the <code>for</code>
loop. This variable is our counter variable, meant to count the number
of trials, out of 10,000, that resulted in at least one student being
angry because they showed up to Sun God with a ticket and were denied
entrance. So all we need to do when there are more than 20,000
<code>True</code> values in the <code>attending</code> array is
increment this counter by one via the code
<code>num_angry = num_angry + 1</code>, sometimes abbreviated as
<code>num_angry += 1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>num_angry/10000</code></p>
<p>To calculate the approximate probability, all we need to do is divide
the number of trials in which a student was angry by the total number of
trials, which is 10,000.</p>

<p>You’re definitely going to Sun God 2022, but you don’t want to go
alone! Fortunately, you have <span class="math inline">n</span> friends
who promise to go with you. Unfortunately, your friends are somewhat
flaky, and each has a probability <span class="math inline">p</span> of
actually going (independent of all others). What is the probability that
you wind up going alone? Give your answer in terms of <span
class="math inline">p</span> and <span class="math inline">n</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <span class="math inline">(1-p)^n</span></p>
<p>If you go alone, it means all of your friends failed to come. We can
think of this as an <em>and</em> condition in order to use
multiplication. The condition is: your first friend doesn’t come
<em>and</em> your second friend doesn’t come, and so on. The probability
of any individual friend not coming is <span class="math inline">1-p</span>, so the probability of all your friends
not coming is <span class="math inline">(1-p)^n</span>.</p>

<p>In past Sun God festivals, sometimes artists that were part of the
lineup have failed to show up! Let’s say there are <span
class="math inline">n</span> artists scheduled for Sun God 2022, and
each artist has a probability <span class="math inline">p</span> of
showing up (independent of all others). What is the probability that the
number of artists that show up is less than <span
class="math inline">n</span>, meaning somebody no-shows? Give your
answer in terms of <span class="math inline">p</span> and <span
class="math inline">n</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <span class="math inline">1-p^n</span></p>
<p>It’s actually easier to figure out the opposite event. The opposite
of somebody no-showing is everybody shows up. This is easier to
calculate because we can think of it as an <em>and</em> condition: the
first artist shows up <em>and</em> the second artist shows up, and so
on. That means we just multiply probabilities. Therefore, the
probability of all artists showing up is <span class="math inline">p^n</span> and the probability of some artist not
showing up is <span class="math inline">1-p^n</span>.</p>
