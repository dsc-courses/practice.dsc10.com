<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous problem, Ashley has sample of 400 rows
of <code>txn</code>. Coincidentally, in Ashley’s sample of 400
transactions, the mean and standard deviation of the

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 350</p>
<p>Chebyshev’s inequality says something about how much data falls
within a given number of standard deviations. The data that doesn’t fall
in that range could be entirely below that range, entirely above that
range, or split some below and some above. So the idea is that we should
figure out the endpoints of the range for which Chebyshev guarantees
that at least 375 transactions must fall. Then at most 25 might fall
above that range. So we’ll fill in the blank with the upper limit of
that range. Now, since there are 400 transactions, 375 as a proportion
becomes <span class="math inline">\frac{375}{400} =
\frac{15}{16}</span>. That’s <span class="math inline">1 -
\frac{1}{16}</span> or <span class="math inline">1 -
\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2</span>, so we should use <span class="math inline">z=4</span> in the statement of Chebyshev’s
inequality. That is, <span class="math inline">\frac{15}{16}</span>
proportion of the data falls within 4 standard deviations of the mean.
The upper endpoint of that range is <span class="math inline">70</span>
(the mean) plus <span class="math inline">4 \cdot 70</span> (four
standard deviations), or <span class="math inline">5 \cdot 70 =
350</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Option B</p>
<p>Here, the main factor which we can use to identify the correct plot
is the correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient of <span class="math inline">-\frac{1}{4}</span> indicates that the data will
have a slight downward trend (values on the y axis will be lower as we
go further right). This narrows it down to option A or option B, but
option A appears to have too strong of a linear trend. We want the data
to look more like a cloud than a line since the correlation is
relatively close to zero, which suggests that option B is the more
viable choice.</p>

<p>Ashley decides to use linear regression to predict the lifetime

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-1.3">Problem 1.3</h3>
<p>The predicted lifetime spending, in <strong>dollars</strong>, of a

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">f =
\frac{1}{4}</span></p>
<p>This problem requires us to make a prediction using the regression
line for a given <span class="math inline">x = 280</span>. We can solve
this problem using original units or standard units. Since 280 is a
multiple of 70, and the mean and standard deviation are both 70, it’s
pretty straightforward to convert 280 to 3 standard units, as <span class="math inline">\frac{(280-70)}{70} = \frac{210}{70} = 3</span>. To
make a prediction in standard units, all we need to do is multiply by
<span class="math inline">r=-\frac{1}{4}</span>, resulting in a
predicted lifetime spending of <span class="math inline">=-\frac{3}{4}</span> in standard units. Since we are
told in the previous subpart that both the mean and standard deviation
of lifetime spending are <span class="math inline">c</span> dollars,
then converting to original units gives <span class="math inline">c +
-\frac{3}{4} \cdot c = \frac{1}{4} \cdot c</span>, so <span class="math inline">f = \frac{1}{4}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> True</p>
<p>Standard units standardize the data into z scores. When converting to
Z scores the scale of both the dependent and independent variables are
the same, and consequently, the slope can at most increase by 1.
Alternatively, according to the reference sheet, the slope of the
regression line, when both variables are measured in standard units, is
also equal to the correlation coefficient. And by definition, the
correlation coefficient can never be greater than 1 (since you can’t
have more than a ‘perfect’ correlation). </p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Options 1, 2, and 5 are correct.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The mean of the new distribution where weight is in pounds would be
given by <span class="math inline">2.2 \cdot \text{mean}</span> in
kilograms. Since the mean in kilograms is positive, this quantity must
then increase if we multiply it by 2.2. Intuitively this should make
sense as we are basically scaling all the (positive) values by 2.2 (a
positive constant), so we expect the values to increase and thus the
mean to increase. So, option 1 is correct.</li>
<li>The standard deviation of the new distribution where weight is in
pounds would be given by <span class="math inline">2.2  \cdot
\text{standard deviation}</span> in kilograms. Since the standard
deviation in kilograms is positive, this quantity must then increase if
we multiply it by 2.2. Intuitively this should make sense as we are
scaling all the values by 2.2, so the difference between larger and
smaller values will be greater once they are scaled. Thus, we expect the
spread of our distribution to be larger, and the standard deviation to
increase. So, option 2 is correct.</li>
<li>We are basically interested in the proportion of <span class="math inline">x_{i}</span> that satisfy <span class="math inline">\vert \frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ} \vert&lt;3</span>,
with <span class="math inline">x_{i}</span> being the values of
<code>"Weight"</code>, μ being the mean in kg and σ being the standard
deviation in kg. Once we scale everything by 2.2 to convert from
kilograms to pounds, we have that<br/>
<span class="math inline">\vert
\frac{2.2x_{i}-2.2μ}{2.2σ}\vert&lt;3</span> → <span class="math inline">\frac{2.2}{2.2}\vert
\frac{x~i~*μ}{σ}\vert&lt;3</span> → <span class="math inline">\vert
\frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ}\vert&lt;3</span>.<br/>
Notice that after we scaled it to pounds, the equation still ends up the
exact same as the one in kg. Thus, the proportion of
<code>"Weight"</code> within 3 standard deviations of the mean stays the
same. Intuitively this should make sense because we are scaling
everything by the same amount, so the proportion of points that are a
specific number of standard deviations away from the mean should be the
same, since the standard deviation and mean get scaled as well. So,
option 3 is incorrect.</li>
<li>Recall that the correlation coefficient, r, is the average value of
the product of two variables, when both variables are measured in
standard units. In kilograms, <code>"Weight"</code>(kg) in standard
units is <span class="math inline">\frac{x~i~−μ}{σ}</span>. Similar to
option 3, <code>"Weight"</code>(pounds) in standard units is <span class="math inline">\frac{2.2x_{i}-2.2μ}{2.2σ} = \frac{2.2}{2.2}
\frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ} = \frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ}</span>. Again, notice
that the equation in pounds ends up the exact same as in kilograms. The
same applies for <code>"Height"</code> in standard units. Since none of
the variables change when measured in standard units, r doesn’t change.
So, option 4 is incorrect.</li>
<li>Intuitively, this makes sense when we imagine a scatterplot with the
y-axis (value being predicted) representing <code>"Weight"</code> and
the x-axis representing <code>"Height"</code>. We expect that the taller
someone is, the heavier they will be. So we can expect a positive
regression line slope between Weight and Height. When we convert Weight
from kg to pounds, we are scaling every value in <code>"Weight"</code>,
making their values increase. When we scale the the weight values
(y-values) to become bigger, we are making the regression slope even
steeper, because an increase in Height (x) now corresponds to an even
larger increase in Weight(y). So, option 5 is correct.</li>
<li>Similar to the last problem, we can also imagine a scatterplot
except this time with <code>"Weight"</code> on the x-axis and
<code>"Height"</code> on the y-axis. Since we are increasing the values
of <code>"Height"</code>, we can imagine stretching the x-axis’ values
without changing the y-values, which makes the line more flat and
therefore decreases the slope. So, option 6 is incorrect. Another
approach to both 5 and 6 is to utilize the correlation coefficient
<em>r</em>, which is equal to the slope times <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span>. We know that multiplying a
set values by a value greater than one increases the spread of the data
which increases standard deviation. In option 5, <code>"Weight"</code>
is in the y-axis, and increasing the numerator of the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span> increases <em>r</em>. In
option 6, <code>"Weight"</code> is in the x-axis, and increasing the
denominator the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span> decreases <em>r</em>.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10</p>
<p>This problem asks about the maximum possible of predicted runs for a
team with <span class="math inline">27</span> hits, and the correlation
coefficient for the case where the predicted number of runs for a team
with <span class="math inline">25</span> hits is maximized. Both of
these questions relate to the same concept, so we can answer them both
in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Concept:</p>
<p>The key idea is that the highest correlation coefficient leads to
maximum predictions. This is because of a simple fact from lecture: When
both <span class="math inline">x</span> (hits) and <span class="math inline">y</span> (runs) are converted to standard units,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">y_\text{pred}</span> (standard units) =
<span class="math inline">r \cdot x</span> (standard units).</p>
<p>So, the maximum slope in standard units, leading to the highest
predictions, is <span class="math inline">1</span>, since <span class="math inline">-1 &lt;= r &lt;= 1</span>. If <span class="math inline">r</span> were any less than <span class="math inline">1</span>, we would be multiplying our <span class="math inline">x</span> value by a smaller number to get our
predicted <span class="math inline">y</span> value, resulting in lower
predictions. In other words,</p>
<p>Max(<span class="math inline">y_\text{pred}</span>) (standard units)
= <span class="math inline">1 \cdot x</span> (standard units).</p>
<p>Let’s apply that to answer part 1.</p>
<p>In part 1, we are asked the maximum possible predicted runs for a
team with <span class="math inline">27</span> hits. <span class="math inline">27</span> in standard units is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\dfrac{(27 - 24)}{3} = 0.5</span>,</p>
<p>and the highest value of <span class="math inline">r</span> (yielding
the maximum predictions) is <span class="math inline">1</span>. So, we
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{Max}\left(y_\text{pred}\right) \text{(standard units) }  = 1 \cdot
0.5
</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{Max}\left(y_\text{pred}\right) \text{(standard units) } = 0.5
</span></p>
<p>Now, we simply need to convert our maximum predicted <span class="math inline">y</span> in standard units back to its original
units, and we have our answer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
y \text{ (standard units)} \cdot \text{SD}_y + \text{Mean}_y = y  \text{
(original units)}.
</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">
0.5 \cdot 4 + 8 = y \text{ (original units)}
</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">
10 = y \text{ (original units)}
</span></p>
<p>So, the maximum number of predicted runs for a team with <span class="math inline">27</span> hits is <span class="math inline">10</span>.</p>

<p>The average score on this problem was 63%.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> ii) 1</p>
<p>Part 2 uses the same information as part 1. The value of <span class="math inline">r</span> that results in the largest predictions of
<span class="math inline">y</span> is <span class="math inline">1</span>
(explained above). So, the correlation coefficient for the case where
the predicted number of runs for a team with <span class="math inline">25</span> hits is maximized is <span class="math inline">1</span>.</p>
