<p>Suppose you are booking a flight and you have no control over which
airline you fly on. Below is a table with multiple airlines and the
probability of a flight being on a specific airline.</p>
<center>
<table class="table" style="width:20%">

<p>For all three flights to be on United, we need the first flight to be
on United, and the second, and the third. Since these are independent
events that do not impact one another, and we need all three flights to
separately be on United, we need to multiply these probabilities, giving
an answer of <span class="math inline">0.3*0.3*0.3 = 0.027</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 0.099</p>
<p>We already calculated the probability of all three flights being on
United as <span class="math inline">(0.3)^3 = 0.027</span>. Similarly,
the probability of all three flights being on Delta is <span class="math inline">(0.4)^3 = 0.064</span>, and the probability of all
three flights being on American is <span class="math inline">(0.2)^3 =
0.008</span>. Since we cannot satisfy more than one of these conditions
at the same time, we can separately add their probabilities to find a
total probability of <span class="math inline">0.027 + 0.064 + 0.008 =
0.099</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> False</p>
<p>It’s not quite the same because the previous subpart doesn’t include
the probability that all three flights are on the same airline which is
not one of Delta, United, or American. For example, there is a small
probability that all three flights are on Allegiant or all three flights
are on Southwest.</p>

<p>It turns out that King Triton is so busy that he doesn’t even book
his own flights – he has a travel agent who books his flights for him.
He doesn’t get to choose the airline that he flies on, but his travel
agent gave him the following table, which describes the probability of
each of his flights in 2022 being on Delta, United, American, or another
airline:</p>
<center>
<table class="table" style="width:20%">

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Airline</th>

<p>Of the 7 rows in the <code>seven_apps</code> DataFrame, there are 6
rows that have a value less than 3 in the <code>dependents</code>
column. This means that if we were to sample <strong>one row</strong>
from <code>seven_apps</code>, there would be a <span class="math inline">\frac{6}{7}</span> chance of selecting one of the
rows that has less than 3 dependents. The question is asking what the
probability that the maximum number of dependents in the resample is
less than 3. One resample of the DataFrame is equivalent to sampling one
row from <code>seven_apps</code> 7 different times, without replacement.
So the probability of getting a row with less than 3 dependents, 7 times
consecutively, is <span class="math inline">\left(
\frac{6}{7}\right)^7</span>.</p>

\frac{6}{7}\right)^7 \right]^{50}</span></p>
<p>We’ll first take a look at the probability of <strong>one
resample</strong> of <code>seven_apps</code> having the maximum number
of dependents be 3. In order for this to happen, at least one row of the
7 selected for the resample must be the row containing 3 dependents. The
probability of getting this row at least once is equal to the complement
of the probability of never getting this row, which we calculated in
part (a) to be <span class="math inline">\left(
\frac{6}{7}\right)^7</span>. Therefore, the probability that at least
one row in the resample has 3 dependents, is <span class="math inline">1
-\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7</span>.</p>
<p>Now that we know the probability of getting one resample where the
maximum number of dependents is 3, we can calculate the probability that
the same thing happens in 50 independent resamples by multiplying this
probability by itself 50 times. Therefore, the probability that the
maximum number of dependents is 3 in each of 50 resamples is <span class="math inline">\left[1 - \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7

<p>The format of the answer suggests we should use the complement rule.
The opposite of at least one application being approved is that no

<p>Tony, the CEO of TritonCard, wants to only issue credit cards whose

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{36}</span></p>
<p>Imagine generating a security code with three unique digits by
selecting one digit at a time. In other words, we would need to select
three values <strong>without replacement</strong> from the set of digits
<span class="math inline">0, 1, 2, \dots, 9</span>. The probability that
the first digit is odd is <span class="math inline">\frac{5}{10}</span>.
Then, assuming the first digit is odd, the probability of the middle
digit being 0 is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{9}</span> since only
nine digits are remaining, and one of them must be 0. Then, assuming we
have chosen an odd number for the first digit and 0 or the middle digit,
there are 8 remaining digits we could select, and only 4 of them are
even, so the probability of the third digit being even is <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{8}</span>. Multiplying these all together

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{40}</span></p>
<p>We’ll use a similar strategy as in the previous part. This time,
however, we need to select three values <strong>with
replacement</strong> from the set of digits <span class="math inline">0,
1, 2, \dots, 9</span>. The probability that the first digit is odd is
<span class="math inline">\frac{5}{10}</span>. Then, assuming the first
digit is odd, the probability of the middle digit being 0 is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{10}</span> since any of the ten digits can
be chosen, and one of them is 0. Then, assuming we have chosen an odd
number for the first digit and 0 or the middle digit, the probability of
getting an even number for the third digit is <span class="math inline">\frac{5}{10}</span>, which actually does not depend
at all on what we selected for the other digits. In fact, when we sample
with replacement, the probabilities of each digit satisfying the given
criteria don’t depend on whether the other digits satisfied the given
criteria (in other words, they are independent). This is different from
the previous part, where knowledge of previous digits satisfying the
criteria informed the chances of the next digit satisfying the criteria.
So for this problem, we can really just think of each of the three
digits separately and multiply their probabilties of meeting the desired
criteria: <span class="math display">\frac{5}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{10}
\cdot \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{40}</span></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Audi</p>
<p>Let’s compute the number of EVs that are either SUVs or sedans for
each non-Nissan Brand. (To do this, we’ll look at the right-most two
columns in the DataFrame provided.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Teslas that are SUVs or sedans: <span class="math inline">4 + 3 = 7</span></li>

<p>Note: You <em>could</em> compute conditional probabilities for each

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{15}</span></p>
<p>We know that the sample space here doesn’t have any of the $100
transactions, so we can ignore the first 4 rows when calculating the
probability. In the remaining 6 rows, there are exactly 2 debit
transactions with <code>"visa"</code> cards, so the probability of our
first transaction being of the specified type is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{6}</span>. There are also two credit
transactions with <code>"visa"</code> cards, but the denominator of the
probability of the second transaction is 5 (not 6), since the sample
space was reduced by one after the first transaction. We’re choosing
without replacement, so you can’t have the same transaction in your
sample twice. Thus, the probability of the second transaction being a
visa credit card is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span>. Now,
we can apply the multiplication rule, and we have that the probability
of both transactions being as described is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{6} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{30} =
\frac{2}{15}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{15}</span></p>
<p>There are only 3 rows in the sample with a transaction amount under
$25, so the chance of choosing one transaction with such a low value is
<span class="math inline">\frac{3}{10}</span>. For the maximum
transaction amount to be less than 25 dollars, this means all
transaction amounts in our sample have to be less than 25 dollars. To
find the chance that all transactions are for less than $25, we can
apply the multiplication rule and multiply the probability of each of
the 15 transactions being less than $25. Since we’re choosing 15 times
with replacement, the events are independent (choosing a certain
transaction on the first try won’t affect the probability of choosing it
again later), so all the terms in our product are <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{10}</span>. Thus, the probability is <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{10} * \frac{3}{10} * \ldots * \frac{3}{10}
= \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{15}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False</p>
<p>If two events are independent, knowledge of one event happening does
not change the probability of the other event happening. In this case,
events <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> are not independent because knowledge of
one event gives complete knowledge of the other.</p>
<p>To see this, note that the probability of choosing a child randomly
out of the fifteen individuals is <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{15}</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">P(B) = \frac{9}{15}</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose now that we know that the chosen individual is an adult. In
this case, the probability that the chosen individual is a child is
<span class="math inline">0</span>, because nobody is both a child and
an adult. That is, <span class="math inline">P(B \text{ given } A) =
0</span>, which is not the same as <span class="math inline">P(B) =
\frac{9}{15}</span>.</p>
<p>This problem illustrates the difference between mutually exclusive
events and independent events. In this case <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> are
mutually exclusive, because they cannot both happen. But that forces
them to be dependent events, because knowing that someone is an adult
completely determines the probability that they are a child (it’s
zero!)</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> True</p>
<p>If two events are independent, the probability of one event happening
does not change when we know that the other event happens. In this case,
events <span class="math inline">C</span> and <span class="math inline">D</span> are indeed independent.</p>
<p>If we know that the chosen individual is a child, the probability
that they come from Family Y is <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{9}</span>, which simplifies to <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{3}</span>. That is <span class="math inline">P(D \text{ given } C) = \frac{1}{3}</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, without any prior knowledge, when we select
someone randomly from all fifteen individuals, the probability they come
from Family Y is <span class="math inline">\frac{5}{15}</span>, which
also simplifies to <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{3}</span>. This
says <span class="math inline">P(D) = \frac{1}{3}</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, knowledge of <span class="math inline">C</span> is
irrelevant to the probability of <span class="math inline">D</span>
occurring, which means <span class="math inline">C</span> and <span class="math inline">D</span> are independent.</p>

<p>The probability of selecting Family W in the first round is <span class="math inline">p</span>, which is the same for the second round,

<p>Since there are too many ways that Family W can be selected to meet
the condition that it is selected at least once, it is easier if we
calculate the probability that Family W is never selected and subtract
that from 1. The probability that Family W is not selected in the first
round is <span class="math inline">1-p</span>, which is the same for the
second round, the third round, and so on. We want this to happen for all
five rounds, and since the events are independent, we can multiply their
probabilities all together. This comes out to be <span class="math inline">(1-p)^5</span>, which represents the probability
that Family W is never selected. Finally, we subtract <span class="math inline">(1-p)^5</span> from 1 to find the probability that
Family W is selected at least once, giving the answer <span class="math inline">1 - (1-p)^5</span>.</p>

* \frac{(n - 2)}{n} * \frac{(n - 3)}{n}</span></p>
<p>For there to be no duplicate books in the first four months, each
subsequent book must be different from the previous ones. After
selecting the first book (which will always be undiplicated), the second
book has <span class="math inline">\frac{(n - 1)}{n}</span> probability
of being unique, the third <span class="math inline">\frac{(n -
2)}{n}</span>, and the fourth <span class="math inline">\frac{(n -
3)}{n}</span>. If you like, you can think of the probability of the
first book being unique as <span class="math inline">\frac{n}{n}</span>
and include it in your answer.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>j/i</code></p>
<p>Looking at the code, we can see that <code>i</code> represents the
number of books with a rating greater than 3, and <code>j</code>
represents the number of books with a rating greater than 4. This is a
conditional probability question: find the probability that Michelle’s
book has a rating greater than 4 given that it has a rating greater than
3. Since we already know Michelle’s book has a rating higher than 3, the
denominator, representing the possible books she could get, should be
<code>i</code>. The numerator represents the books that meet our desired
condition of having a rating greater than 4, which is <code>j</code>.
Therefore, the result is <code>j/i</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 0.2</p>
<p>We want to find the probability that Stella assembles the bed frame
in 10 minutes, given that she assembles it in less than 30 minutes. The
multiplication rule can be rearranged to find the conditional
probability of one event given another.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned}
        P(A \text{ and } B) &amp;= P(A \text{ given } B)*P(B)\\
        P(A \text{ given } B) &amp;= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
\end{aligned}</span></p>
<p>Let’s, therefore, define events <span class="math inline">A</span>
and <span class="math inline">B</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">A</span> is the event that Stella
assembles the bed frame in 10 minutes.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">B</span> is the event that Stella
assembles the bed frame in less than 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 10 minutes is less than 30 minutes, <span class="math inline">A
\text{ and } B</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">A</span>
in this case. Therefore, <span class="math inline">P(A \text{ and } B) =
P(A) = 0.1</span>.</p>
<p>Since there are only two ways to complete the bed frame in less than
30 minutes (10 minutes or 20 minutes), it is straightforward to find
<span class="math inline">P(B)</span> using the addition rule <span class="math inline">P(B) = 0.1 + 0.4</span>. The addition rule can be
used here because assembling the bed frame in 10 minutes and assembling
the bed frame in 20 minutes are mutually exclusive. We could
alternatively find <span class="math inline">P(B)</span> using the
complement rule, since the only way not to complete the bed frame in
less than 30 minutes is to complete it in exactly 30 minutes, which
happens with a probability of 0.5. We’d get the same answer, <span class="math inline">P(B) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging these numbers in gives our answer.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned}
        P(A \text{ given } B) &amp;= \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}\\
                              &amp;= \frac{0.1}{0.5}\\
                              &amp;= 0.2

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 0.53</p>
<p>There are several different ways for the total assembly time to take

<li>The bed frame takes 10 minutes and the bedside table takes any

<li>The bed frame takes 20 minutes and the bedside table takes 30 or 40

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <code>[-4, -3. -2, -1]</code></p>
<p>Let’s break down the code line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.groupby("Major")</code> will group the survey DataFrame by
the <code>"Major"</code> column.</li>
<li><code>.count()</code> will count the number of students in each
major.</li>
<li><code>.sort_values("College")</code> sort these counts in ascending
order using the <code>"College"</code> column (which now contains
counts).</li>
<li><code>.take([-4, -3. -2, -1])</code> will take the last 4 rows of
the DataFrame, which will correspond to the 4 most common majors.</li>
<li><code>.get("Section")</code> get the <code>"Section"</code> column,
which also contains counts.</li>
<li><code>.plot(kind="barh")</code> will plot these counts in a
horizontal bar chart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument we give to <code>take</code> is
<code>[-4, -3, -2, -1]</code>, because that will give us back a
DataFrame corresponding to the counts of the 4 most common majors, with
the most common major (<code>"MA30"</code>) at the bottom. We want the
most common major at the bottom of the Series that
<code>.plot(kind="barh")</code> is called on because the bottom row will
correspond to the top bar – remember, <code>kind="barh"</code> plots one
bar per row, but in reverse order.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <span class="math inline">\frac{8^k -
7^k}{8^k}</span></p>
<p>Of the 80 students in popular majors, 10 are in <code>"CG35"</code>.
To determine the likelihood of selecting at least one
<code>"CG35"</code> major out of <strong><span class="math inline">k</span></strong> random draws with replacement, we
first find the probability of not drawing a <code>"CG35"</code> major in
all <strong><span class="math inline">k</span></strong> attempts by
following the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The probability of not selecting a <code>"CG35"</code> major in
one draw is <span class="math inline">1</span> - <span class="math inline">\frac{10}{80}</span> = <span class="math inline">1</span> - <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{8}</span> = <span class="math inline">\frac{7}{8}</span></p></li>
<li><p>The probability of not selecting a <code>"CG35"</code> major in
<strong><span class="math inline">k</span></strong> draws is, then,
<span class="math inline">\frac{7^k}{8^k}</span>, since each draw is
independent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, by subtracting this probability from 1, we get the probability
of drawing at least one <code>"CG35"</code> major in those <strong><span class="math inline">k</span></strong> attempts. So, the probability of
selecting at least one <code>"CG35"</code> major in <strong><span class="math inline">k</span></strong> attempts is <span class="math display">1 - \frac{7^k}{8^k} = \frac{8^k}{8^k} -
\frac{7^k}{8^k} = \frac{8^k - 7^k}{8^k}</span></p>

<p>In order to get this combination of roommates, we can use similar
logic as before. From Kathleen’s perspective, there are 5 tutors that
are equally likely to become her roommate. So, the probability that
Sophia ends up being Kathleen’s roommate is <span class="math inline">\displaystyle\frac{1}{5}</span>. From there, we can
view the situation from Kate’s perspective; Kate sees that there are 3
potential roommates left (Ashley, Claire, Vivian). So, the probability
that Sophia ends up being Kathleen’s roommate (given Kathleen and Sophia
are together) is <span class="math inline">\displaystyle\frac{1}{3}</span>. After Kate chooses
her roommate, Claire and Vivian end up together by process of
elimination. We can multiply these two probabilities to recieve: <span class="math inline">\displaystyle\frac{1}{5} \cdot
\displaystyle\frac{1}{5} = \displaystyle\frac{1}{15}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False</p>
<p>If two events A and B are independent then P(A and B) = P(A)P(B). In
this question we can define A as “selecting a shipping container from
Vietnam” and B as “selecting a shipping container from Ireland”.
Therefore (A and B) would be “selecting a (single) shipping container
from both Vietnam and Ireland”. Since that is impossible, P(A and B) = 0
while P(A)P(B) = 0.012. Therefore these two events are
<strong>not</strong> independent.</p>

<li>Three shipping containers</li>

<p>This means that we have three trials with replacement, all looking

<p>There’s been an expansion of Collegiate Mario Kart across the
country, so to determine a champion, we’d like to set up a bracket for a
Mario Kart tournament and fill it with four college teams from
<code>bigkart</code>. We won’t display <code>bigkart</code> for this
question, but assume it’s a larger version of <code>kart</code>: there
are 50 rows in <code>bigkart</code>, and thus 50 teams. Selection is
performed uniformly at random, so that each team has the same chance of
being selected. Please leave your answers in
<strong>unsimplified</strong> form: answers of the form <span

<p>It’s easier to calculate the probability that the number has no 7 in

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span></p>
<p>First, let’s understand what <code>df_choice</code> does. It takes in
one input, <code>df</code>. The line
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
evaluates to an array such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is one element for every row in the input DataFrame or array
<code>df</code> (so if <code>df</code> has 31 rows, the output array
will have length 31)</li>
<li>Each element is equally likely to be <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code>, since the sequence we are selecting from is
<code>[True, False]</code> and we are selecting with replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>So
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
is an array the same length as <code>df</code>, with each element
randomly set to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Note that there
is a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance the first
element is <code>True</code>, a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance the second element is
<code>True</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Then,
<code>df[np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)]</code>
is using Boolean indexing to keep only the rows in <code>df</code> where
the array
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
contains the value <code>True</code>. So, the function
<code>df_choice</code> returns a <strong>DataFrame</strong> containing
somewhere between 0 and <code>df.shape[0]</code> rows. Note that there
is a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance that the new
DataFrame contains the first row from <code>df</code>, a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance that the new DataFrame
contains the second row from <code>df</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>In this question, the only input ever given to <code>df_choice</code>
is <code>plum</code>, which has 31 rows.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this subpart, we’re asked for the probability that
<code>df_choice(plum)</code> is an empty DataFrame. There are 31 rows,
and each of them have a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>
chance of being included in the output, and so a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance of being missing. So, the
chance that they are all missing is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned} P(\text{empty DataFrame})
&amp;= P(\text{all rows missing}) \\ &amp;= P(\text{row 0 missing and
row 1 missing and ... and row 30 missing}) \\ &amp;= P(\text{row 0

<p>In order for the resulting DataFrame to have 30 rows, exactly 1 row
must be missing, and the other 30 must be present.</p>
<p>To start, let’s consider one row in particular, say, row 7. The
probability that row 7 is missing is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>, and the probability that rows 0
through 6 and 8 through 30 are all present is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ... \cdot
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2^{30}}</span> using the logic from the previous
subpart. So, the probability that row 7 is missing AND all other rows
are present is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot
\frac{1}{2^{30}} = \frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>.</p>
<p>Then, in order for there to be 30 rows, either row 0 must be missing,
or row 1 must be missing, and so on:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned} P(\text{exactly one row
missing}) &amp;= P(\text{only row 0 is missing or only row 1 is missing

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> True</p>
<p>An important realization to make is that all <strong>subsets</strong>
of the rows in <code>plum</code> are equally likely to be returned by
<code>df_choice(plum)</code>, and they all have probability <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>. For instance, one subset of
<code>plum</code> is the subset where rows 2, 5, 8, and 30 are missing,
and the rest are all present. The probability that this subset is
returned by <code>df_choice(plum)</code> is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>.</p>
<p>This is true because for each individual row, the probability that it
is present or missing is the same – <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> – so the probability of any
subset is a product of 31 <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>s,
which is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>. (The answer
to the previous subpart was not <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span> because it was asking about
multiple subsets – the subset where only row 0 was missing, and the
subset where only row 1 was missing, and so on).</p>
<p>So, the probability that <code>df_choice(plum)</code> consists of
just row 0 is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>, and
this is the same as the answer to the first subpart (<span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>); in both situations, we are
calculating the probability of one specific subset.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{25}}</span></p>
<p>Here, we’re not being asked for the probability of one specific
subset (like the subset containing just row 0); rather, we’re being
asked for the probability of various different subsets, so our
calculation will be a bit more involved.</p>
<p>We can break our problem down into four pieces. We can find the
probability that there are 0 rows, 1 row, 30 rows, and 31 rows
individually, and add these probabilities up, since only one of them can
happen at a time (it’s impossible for a DataFrame to have both 1 and 30
rows at the same time; these events are “mutually exclusive”). It turns
out we’ve already calculated two of these probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the first subpart, the probability that 0 rows are returned is
<span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>. This corresponds to a
single subset, the subset where all rows are missing.</li>
<li>From the second subpart, the probability that 30 rows are returned
is <span class="math inline">\frac{31}{2^{31}}</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other two possibilities are <em>symmetric</em> with the above
two!</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that 31 rows are returned is the same as the
probability that 0 rows are returned, since the probability of a row
being missing and a row being present is the same. This is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>.</li>
<li>The probability that 1 row is returned is the same as the
probability that 1 row is missing, i.e. the probability that 30 rows are
returned. This, from the second subpart, is <span class="math inline">\frac{31}{2^{31}}</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting it all together, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned} P(\text{number of returned
rows is 0, 1, 30, or 31}) &amp;= P(\text{0 rows are returned}) +
P(\text{1 row is returned}) + P(\text{30 rows are returned}) +
P(\text{31 rows are returned}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2^{31}} +

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2^{31}}</span></p>
<p>First, let’s understand what <code>df_choice</code> does. It takes in
one input, <code>df</code>. The line
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
evaluates to an array such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is one element for every row in the input DataFrame or array
<code>df</code> (so if <code>df</code> has 31 rows, the output array
will have length 31)</li>
<li>Each element is equally likely to be <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code>, since the sequence we are selecting from is
<code>[True, False]</code> and we are selecting with replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>So
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
is an array the same length as <code>df</code>, with each element
randomly set to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Note that there
is a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance the first
element is <code>True</code>, a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance the second element is
<code>True</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Then,
<code>df[np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)]</code>
is using Boolean indexing to keep only the rows in <code>df</code> where
the array
<code>np.random.choice([True, False], df.shape[0], replace=True)</code>
contains the value <code>True</code>. So, the function
<code>df_choice</code> returns a <strong>DataFrame</strong> containing
somewhere between 0 and <code>df.shape[0]</code> rows. Note that there
is a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance that the new
DataFrame contains the first row from <code>df</code>, a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance that the new DataFrame
contains the second row from <code>df</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>In this question, the only input ever given to <code>df_choice</code>
is <code>plum</code>, which has 31 rows.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this subpart, we’re asked for the probability that
<code>df_choice(plum)</code> is an empty DataFrame. There are 31 rows,
and each of them have a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>
chance of being included in the output, and so a <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> chance of being missing. So, the
chance that they are all missing is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{aligned} P(\text{empty DataFrame})
&amp;= P(\text{all rows missing}) \\ &amp;= P(\text{row 0 missing and
row 1 missing and ... and row 30 missing}) \\ &amp;= P(\text{row 0
missing}) \cdot P(\text{row 1 missing}) \cdot ... \cdot P(\text{row 30
missing}) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ... \cdot

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{31}{2^{31}}</span></p>
<p>In order for the resulting DataFrame to have 30 rows, exactly 1 row
must be missing, and the other 30 must be present.</p>
<p>To start, let’s consider one row in particular, say, row 7. The
probability that row 7 is missing is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>, and the probability that rows 0
through 6 and 8 through 30 are all present is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ... \cdot
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2^{30}}</span> using the logic from the previous
subpart. So, the probability that row 7 is missing AND all other rows
are present is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot
\frac{1}{2^{30}} = \frac{1}{2^{31}}</span>.</p>
<p>Then, in order for there to be 30 rows, either row 0 must be missing,
or row 1 must be missing, and so on:</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 0.344</p>
<p>Whenever we are asked to compute the probability of “at least one”
occurrence of some event, it is almost always easiest to compute the
<strong>complement</strong> of (i.e. “1 minus”) the probability that
there are no occurrences of the event. That is the case here; as such,
we need to compute the probability that none of the 10th floors are

across all four buildings, we first need to find the probability that
the 10th floor is not selected in just a single building. This is <span class="math inline">1 - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{9}{10}</span>. Then, since
the selections in each building are independent of other buildings, the
probability that none of the 10th floors are selected across all four
buildings is <span class="math inline">\left( \frac{9}{10}
\right)^4</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the probability we are asked for is the complement of the
probability we just computed. So, the probability that at least one 10th
floor is selected across all four buildings is</p>
<p><span class="math display">1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{10} \right)^4 = 1
- \left( \frac{9}{10} \right)^4 = 1 - 0.6561 = 0.3439</span></p>
<p>This rounds to 0.344.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>Series</code></p>
<p><code>strategy</code> will give you a <code>Series</code>. This is
because <code>games.get(“Domains”)</code> will give you one column, a
<code>Series</code>, and then
<code>.str.contains(“Strategy Games”)</code> will convert those values
to <code>True</code> if it contains that string and <code>False</code>
otherwise, but it will not actually change the <code>Series</code> to a

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
<code>(games[(strategy == True) &amp; (thematic == False)].shape[0] / games[strategy == True].shape[0])</code>
or
<code>1 - games[strategy &amp; thematic].shape[0] / games[strategy].shape[0]</code></p>
<p>The problem is asking us to find the probability that a selected game
from <code>“Strategy Games”</code> will <strong>not</strong> be in
<code>“Thematic Games”</code>. Recall that this is the probability that
given <code>“Strategy Games”</code> will it not be in
<code>“Thematic Games”</code>, which would look like this:
P(<code>“Thematic Games”</code>
Compliment|<code>“Strategy Games”</code>). This means the formula would
look like: (<code>“Thematic Games”</code> Compliment
<strong>and</strong>
<code>“Strategy Games”</code>)/<code>“Strategy Games”</code></p>
<p>This means one possible solution for this would be:
<code>(games[(strategy == True) &amp; (thematic == False)].shape[0] / games[strategy == True].shape[0]</code>
This solution works because we are following the formula to find the
probability of thematic complement and strategy games over the number of
times <code>“Strategy Games”</code> are <code>True</code>. Doing
<code>games[query_condition]</code> gives us the <code>games</code>
DataFrame where <code>strategy == True</code> and
<code>thematic == False</code>. Another important thing is that for
(baby)pandas we always use the keyword <code>&amp;</code> and not
<code>and</code>. Note that we are using <code>.shape[0]</code> to get
the number of rows or times that <code>True</code> shows up for
<code>“Strategy Games”</code> and the number of rows or times that
<code>False</code> shows up for <code>“Thematic Games”</code>
Compliment.</p>
<p>Another possible strategy would be using the complement rule: Which
would be: P(<code>“Thematic Games”</code> Compliment) = 1 -
P(<code>“Thematic Games”</code>). This would lead you to an answer like:
<code>(1 - games[strategy &amp; thematic].shape[0]) / games[strategy].shape[0]</code>.
<code>games[strategy &amp; thematic].shape[0])</code> finds you the
probability of P(<code>“Thematic Games”</code>), so when plugged into
the equation above we are able to find P(<code>“Thematic Games”</code>
Compliment).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Options 3 and 4</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at why <strong>Option 3</strong> and
<strong>Option 4</strong> are correct.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3</strong>: Option 3 first queries the
<code>games</code> DataFrame to only keep <code>games</code> with one
<code>“Domains”</code>.
<code>games.get(“Domains”).str.split(“,”).apply(len) == 1</code> gets
the <code>“Domains”</code> column and splits all of them if they contain
a comma. If the value does have a comma then it will create a list. For
example let’s say the domain was
<code>“Strategy Games”, “Thematic Games”</code> then after doing
<code>str.split(“,”)</code> we would have the <code>list</code>:
<code>[“Strategy Games”, “Thematic Games”]</code>. Any row with a
<code>list</code> will evaluate to <code>False</code>. This means we are
only keeping values where there is <strong>one</strong> domain. The next
part <code>.groupby(“Domains”).count().get(“Name”).sum()</code> makes a
DataFrame with an index of the unique domains and the number of times
those appear. Note that all the other columns: <code>“Name”</code>,
<code>“Mechanics”</code>, <code>“Play Time”</code>,
<code>“Complexity”</code>, <code>“Rating”</code>, and
<code>“BGG Rank”</code> now evaluate to the same thing, the number of
times a unique domain appears. That means by doing
<code>.get(“Name”).sum()</code> we are adding up all the number of times
a unique domain appears, which would get us the number of games that
belong to only one domain.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4</strong>: Option 4 starts off exactly like Option 3,
but instead of doing <code>.groupby()</code> it gets the number of rows
using <code>.shape[0]</code>, which will give us the number of games
that belong to only one domain.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Let’s step through why Option 1 is
incorrect.
<code>games.get(“Domains”).str.split(“ ”).apply(len) == 2.sum()</code>
gives you a <code>Series</code> of the <code>“Domains”</code> column,
then splits each domain by a space. We then get the length of that
<code>list</code>, check if the length is equal to 2, which would mean
there are two elements in the <code>list</code>, and finally get the sum
of all elements in the list who had two elements because of the split.
Remember that <code>True</code> evaluates to 1 and <code>False</code>
evaluates to 0, so we are getting the number of elements that were split
into two. It does not tell us the number of games that belong to only
one domain.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Let’s step through why Option 2 is also
incorrect. <code>(games.get(“Domains”).apply(len) == 1).sum()</code>
checks to see if each element in the column <code>“Domains”</code> has
only one character. Remember when you apply <code>len()</code> to a
string then we get the number of characters in that string. This is
essentially counting the number of domains that have 1 letter. Thus, it
does not tell us the number of games that belong to only one domain.</p>

<h3 id="problem-24.1">Problem 24.1</h3>
<p>Hurricane forecasters use complex models to simulate hurricanes.
Suppose a forecaster simulates 10,000 hurricanes and keeps track of the
state where each hurricane made landfall in an array called
<code>landfalls</code>. Each element of <code>landfalls</code> is a
string, which is either the full name of a US state or the string
<code>"None"</code> if the storm did not hit land in the simulation.</p>
<p>The forecaster wants to use the results of their simulation to
estimate the probability that a given storm hits Georgia. Write one line
of Python code that approximates this probability, using the data in
<code>landfalls</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
<code>np.count_nonzero(landfalls == "Georgia") / 10000</code></p>
<p>The probability would be the number of times the storm hit Georgia
over the total number of simulated hurricanes, which is 10000. Since
each element of <code>landfills</code> is a string, we can use
<code>np.count_nonzero()</code> to give us all of the times the storm
hits Georgia in the simulation. Recall <code>np.count_nonzero()</code>
determines whether the elements are “truthy”, so if the String was equal
to <code>"Georgia"</code> then it would be counted, and otherwise would
be ignored. Then to calculate the probability we simply divide the
number of times the storm hit Georgia by 10000.</p>

<p>We can calculate the answer using the multiplication rule. The

weapon card on the sixth draw. The denominator of each subsequent

Janine is dealt is a weapon card. This probability can be expressed in
the form <span class="math display">\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{m \cdot (m +
1)}</span> where <span class="math inline">k</span> and <span
class="math inline">m</span> are <strong>integers</strong>. What are the
values of <span class="math inline">k</span> and <span
class="math inline">m</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: There is no need for any sort of calculation
that you can’t do easily in your head, such as long division or
multiplication.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">k</span> = 12,
<span class="math inline">m</span> = 18</p>
<p><span class="math inline">m</span> has to be 18 because the
denominator is the number of cards available during the first and second
draw. We have 19 cards on the first draw and 18 on the second draw, so
the only way to get that is for <span class="math inline">m</span> =
18.</p>
<p>The probability that exactly one of the cards of your first two draws
is a weapon card can be broken down into two cases: getting a weapon
card first and then a non-weapon card, or getting a non-weapon card
first and then a weapon card. We add the probabilities of the two cases
together in order to calculate the overall probability, since the cases
are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same
time.</p>
<p>Consider first the probability of getting a weapon card followed by a
non-weapon card. This probability is <span class="math inline">\frac{6}{19} \cdot \frac{13}{18}</span>. Similarly,
the probability of getting a non-weapon card first, then a weapon card,
is <span class="math inline">\frac{13}{19} \cdot \frac{6}{18}</span>.
The sum of these is <span class="math inline">\frac{6 \cdot 13}{19 \cdot
18}</span> + <span class="math inline">\frac{13 \cdot 6}{19 \cdot
18}</span>.</p>
<p>Since we want the numerator to look like <span class="math inline">k
\cdot (k+1)</span>, we want to combine the terms in the numerator. Since
the fractions in the sum are the same, we can represent the probability
as <span class="math inline">2 \cdot \frac{6}{19} \cdot
\frac{13}{18}</span>. Since <span class="math inline">2\cdot 6 =
12</span>, we can express the numerator as <span class="math inline">12
\cdot 13</span>, so <span class="math inline">k</span> = 12.</p>

<h2 id="problem-27">Problem 27</h2>
<p>When new students arrive at Hogwarts, they get assigned to one of the
four houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin) by a magical
Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>Throughout this problem, we’ll assume that the Sorting Hat assigns
students to houses uniformly at random, meaning that each student has an
independent 25% chance of winding up in each of the four houses.</p>
<p>For all parts, give your answer as an <strong>unsimplified
mathematical expression</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\left(0.25\right)^{7}</span></p>
<p>The probability that a student gets assigned to Gryffindor is 0.25
(or <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}</span>). Since we are given
that the Sorting Hat assigns students independently, we can apply the
multiplication rule and multiply the probability of each of the seven
Weasleys being sorted to Gryffindor together. Therefore, all terms in
our product are 0.25. Thus, the probability that all seven Weasleys get
assigned to Gryffindor would be <span class="math inline">0.25 * 0.25 *
\ldots * 0.25 = \left(0.25\right)^{7}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 0.25</p>
<p>Fred and George are assigned to the same house if both are in
Gryffindor, or both are in Hufflepuff, etc.. Fred and George’s
selections from the sorting hat are independent. Using the
multiplication rule, <span class="math inline">P(both in Gryffindor) =
0.25 * 0.25</span>. Likewise, <span class="math inline">P(both in
Hufflepuff) = 0.25 * 0.25</span>. It is the same for Ravenclaw and
Slytherin as well. Therefore, <span class="math inline">P(same house) =
4 * (0.25 * 0.25) = 0.25</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\left(0.75\right)^{7}</span></p>
<p>The probability that none of the seven Weasley siblings are assigned
to Slytherin is equal to the probability that all of the Weasley
siblings are not assigned to Slytherin. The probability that someone is
not assigned to Slytherin is <span class="math inline">1 - P(Slytherin)

<p>Since we are given that none of the Weasley siblings are assigned to
