<h3 id="problem-1.1">Problem 1.1</h3>
<p>Now, the Museum of Natural History wants to know how many visitors
they have in a year. However, their computer systems are rather archaic
and so they aren’t able to keep track of the number of tickets sold for
an entire year. Instead, they randomly select five days in the year, and
keep track of the number of visitors on those days. Let’s call these
numbers <span class="math inline">v_1</span>, <span
class="math inline">v_2</span>, <span class="math inline">v_3</span>,
<span class="math inline">v_4</span>, and <span
class="math inline">v_5</span>.</p>
<p>Which of the following is the best estimate the number of visitors
for the entire year?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> <span class="math inline">v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + v_5</span></p></li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{365}{5}\cdot(v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 +
v_5)</span></p>
<p>Our sample is the number of visitors on the five days, and our
population is the number of visitors in all 365 days.</p>
<p>First, we calculate the sample mean, the average number of visitors
in the 5 days, which is <span class="math inline">m =
\frac{1}{5}\cdot(v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + v_5)</span>. We use this
statistic to estimate the population mean, the average number of
visitors in this year.</p>
<p>Then, we use the estimated population mean to calculate the estimated
pupulation sum, so we multiply the number of days in a year (365) with
the estimated population mean. We get <span class="math display">365 m =
\frac{365}{5}\cdot(v_1 + v_2 + v_3 + v_4 + v_5)</span></p>

<h3 id="problem-1.2">Problem 1.2</h3>
<p>Now we’re interested in predicting the admission cost of a museum
based on its number of visitors. Suppose:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>admission cost and number of visitors are linearly associated
with a correlation coefficient of 0.25,</p></li>
<li><p>the number of visitors at the Museum of Natural History is six
standard deviations below average,</p></li>
<li><p>the average cost of museum admission is 15 dollars, and</p></li>
<li><p>the standard deviation of admission cost is 3 dollars.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What would the regression line predict for the admission cost (in
dollars) at the Museum of Natural History? Give your answer as a number
without any units, rounded to three decimal places.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10.500</p>
<p>Recall, we can make predictions in standard units with the following
formula</p>
<p><span class="math display"> \text{predicted}\ y_{su} = r \cdot
x_{su}</span></p>
<p>We’re given that the correlation coefficient, <span class="math inline">r</span>, between visitors and admission cost is
0.25. Here, we’re using the number of visitors (<span class="math inline">x</span>) to predict admission cost (<span class="math inline">y</span>). Given that the number of visitors at the
Museum of Natural History is 6 standard deviations
<strong>below</strong> average,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted}\ y_{su} =  r \cdot x_{su}
= 0.25 \cdot -6 =  -1.5</span></p>
<p>We then compute y, which is the admission cost (in dollars) at the
Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*} y_{su} &amp;= \frac{y-
\text{Mean of } y}{\text{SD of } y}\\
-1.5 &amp;= \frac{y-15}{3} \\
-1.5 \cdot 3 &amp;= y-15\\
-4.5 + 15 &amp;= y\\
y &amp;= \boxed{10.5}
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>So, the regression line predicts that the admission cost at the
Museum of Natural History is $10.50.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>In this question, we’ll explore the relationship between the ages and
incomes of credit card applicants.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-2.1">Problem 2.1</h3>
<p>The credit card company that owns the data in <code>apps</code>,
BruinCard, has decided not to give us access to the entire
<code>apps</code> DataFrame, but instead just a sample of
<code>apps</code> called <code>small_apps</code>. We’ll start by using
the information in <code>small_apps</code> to compute the regression
line that predicts the age of an applicant given their income.</p>
<p>For an applicant with an income that is <span
class="math inline">\frac{8}{3}</span> standard deviations above the
mean income, we predict their age to be <span
class="math inline">\frac{4}{5}</span> standard deviations above the
mean age. What is the correlation coefficient, <span
class="math inline">r</span>, between incomes and ages in
<code>small_apps</code>? Give your answer as a <strong>fully simplified
fraction</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.2">Problem 2.2</h3>
<p>Now, we want to predict the income of an applicant given their age.
We will again use the information in <code>small_apps</code> to find the
regression line. The regression line predicts that an applicant whose
age is <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{5}</span> standard deviations
above the mean age has an income that is <span
class="math inline">s</span> standard deviations above the mean income.
What is the value of <span class="math inline">s</span>? Give your
answer as a <strong>fully simplified fraction</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">s =

<p>We again use the equation of the regression line in standard units,
with the value of <span class="math inline">r</span> we found in the
previous part. <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} &amp;= r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}} \\
s &amp;= \frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\
s &amp;= \frac{6}{25}
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>Notice that when we predict income based on age, our predictions are
different than when we predict age based on income. That is, the answer
to this question is <strong>not</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{3}</span>. We can think of this phenomenon
as a consequence of <em>regression to the mean</em> which means that the
predicted variable is always closer to average than the original
variable. In part (a), we start with an income of <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{3}</span> standard units and predict an age
of <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{5}</span> standard units, which is
closer to average than <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{3}</span>
standard units. Then in part (b), we start with an age of <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{5}</span> and predict an income of <span class="math inline">\frac{6}{25}</span> standard units, which is closer
to average than <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{5}</span> standard
units. This happens because whenever we make a prediction, we multiply
by <span class="math inline">r</span> which is less than one in
magnitude.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.3">Problem 2.3</h3>
<p>BruinCard has now taken away our access to both <code>apps</code> and
<code>small_apps</code>, and has instead given us access to an even
smaller sample of <code>apps</code> called <code>mini_apps</code>. In
<code>mini_apps</code>, we know the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>All incomes and ages are positive numbers.</li>
<li>There is a positive linear association between incomes and
ages.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the data in <code>mini_apps</code> to find the regression line
that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant given their
age. Just to test the limits of this regression line, we use it to
predict the income of an applicant who is <strong>-2 years old</strong>,
even though it doesn’t make sense for a person to have a negative
age.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">I</span> be the regression line’s
prediction of this applicant’s income. Which of the following
inequalities are guaranteed to be satisfied? Select all that apply.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" /> <span class="math inline">I &lt; 0</span></p></li>

<li><p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">I &lt; \text{mean
income}</span>, <span class="math inline">\dfrac{| I - \text{mean
income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \leq \dfrac{| \text{mean
age} + 2 |}{\text{standard deviation of ages}}</span></p>
<p>To understand this answer, we will investigate each option.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">I &lt; 0</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>This option asks whether income is guaranteed to be negative. This is
not necessarily true. For example, it’s possible that the slope of the
regression line is <span class="math inline">2</span> and the intercept
is <span class="math inline">10</span>, in which case the income
associated with a <span class="math inline">-2</span> year old would be
<span class="math inline">6</span>, which is positive.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">I &lt; \text{mean income}</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>This option asks whether the predicted income is guaranteed to be
lower than the mean income. It helps to think in standard units. In
standard units, the regression line goes through the point <span class="math inline">(0, 0)</span> and has slope <span class="math inline">r</span>, which we are told is positive. This means
that for a below-average <span class="math inline">x</span>, the
predicted <span class="math inline">y</span> is also below average. So
this statement must be true.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">| I - \text{mean income}| \leq |
\text{mean age} + 2 |</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>First, notice that <span class="math inline">| \text{mean age} + 2 |
= | -2 - \text{mean age}|</span>, which represents the horizontal
distance betweeen these two points on the regression line: <span class="math inline">(\text{mean age}, \text{mean income})</span>, <span class="math inline">(-2, I)</span>. Likewise, <span class="math inline">| I - \text{mean income}|</span> represents the
vertical distance between those same two points. So the inequality can
be interpreted as a question of whether the <em>rise</em> of the
regression line is less than or equal to the <em>run</em>, or whether
the slope is at most 1. That’s not guaranteed when we’re working in
original units, as we are here, so this option is not necessarily
true.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\dfrac{| I - \text{mean
income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \leq \dfrac{| \text{mean
age} + 2 |}{\text{standard deviation of ages}}</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p>Since standard deviation cannot be negative, we have <span class="math display">\dfrac{| I - \text{mean income}|}{\text{standard
deviation of incomes}} = \left| \dfrac{I - \text{mean
income}}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \right| =
I_{\text{(su)}}.</span> Similarly, <span class="math display">\dfrac{|\text{mean age} + 2|}{\text{standard
deviation of ages}} = \left| \dfrac{-2 - \text{mean age}}{\text{standard
deviation of ages}} \right| = -2_{\text{(su)}}.</span> So this option is
asking about whether the predicted income, in standard units, is
guaranteed to be less (in absolute value) than the age. Since we make
predictions in standard units using the equation of the regression line
<span class="math inline">\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} = r \cdot
x_{\text{(su)}}</span> and we know <span class="math inline">|r|\leq
1</span>, this means <span class="math inline">|\text{predicted }
y_{\text{(su)}}| \leq | x_{\text{(su)}}|</span>. Applying this to ages
(<span class="math inline">x</span>) and incomes (<span class="math inline">y</span>), this says exactly what the given
inequality says. This is the phenomenon we call <em>regression to the
mean</em>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.4">Problem 2.4</h3>
<p>Yet again, BruinCard, the company that gave us access to
<code>apps</code>, <code>small_apps</code>, and <code>mini_apps</code>,
has revoked our access to those three DataFrames and instead has given
us <code>micro_apps</code>, an even smaller sample of
<code>apps</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>micro_apps</code>, we are again interested in finding the
regression line that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant
given their age. We are given the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The correlation coefficient, <span class="math inline">r</span>,
between ages and incomes is <span
class="math inline">-\frac{1}{3}</span> (note the negative sign).</li>
<li>The mean income is <span class="math inline">\frac{7}{2}</span>
(remember, incomes are measured in tens of thousands of dollars).</li>
<li>The mean age is 33.</li>
<li>The regression line predicts that a 24 year old applicant has an
income of <span class="math inline">\frac{31}{2}</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose the standard deviation of incomes in <code>micro_apps</code>
is an integer multiple of the standard deviation of ages in
<code>micro_apps</code>. That is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{standard deviation of income} = k
\cdot \text{standard deviation of age}.</span></p>
<p>What is the value of <span class="math inline">k</span>? Give your

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">k = 4</span></p>
<p>To find this answer, we’ll use the definition of the regression line
in original units, which is <span class="math inline">\text{predicted }
y = mx+b</span>, where <span class="math display">m = r \cdot
\frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x}, \: \: b = \text{mean of } y - m
\cdot \text{mean of } x</span></p>
<p>Next we substitute these value for <span class="math inline">m</span>
and <span class="math inline">b</span> into <span class="math inline">\text{predicted } y = mx + b</span>, interpret <span class="math inline">x</span> as age and <span class="math inline">y</span> as income, and use the given information to
find <span class="math inline">k</span>. <span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y &amp;= mx+b \\
\text{predicted } y &amp;= r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of

\text{predicted income}&amp;= r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of
income}}{\text{SD of age}} \cdot \text{age}+ \text{mean income} - r

\\
\frac{31}{2}&amp;= -\frac{1}{3} \cdot k \cdot 24+ \frac{7}{2} +
\frac{1}{3} \cdot k \cdot 33 \\
\frac{31}{2}&amp;= -8k+ \frac{7}{2} + 11k \\
\frac{31}{2}&amp;= 3k+ \frac{7}{2}  \\
3k &amp;= \frac{31}{2} - \frac{7}{2} \\
3k &amp;= 12 \\
k &amp;= 4
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>Another way to solve this problem uses the equation of the regression

\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} &amp;= r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}} \\

<p>Dhruv works at the bookstore, and his job involves pricing new books
that come in from the supplier. He prices new books based on the number
of pages they have. He does this using linear regression, which he
learned about in DSC 10.</p>
<p>To build his regression line, Dhruv gathers the following information
about the distinct books currently available at the bookstore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The correlation between price and number of pages is <span
class="math inline">0.6</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mean price of all books is $15, with a standard deviation of
$4.</p></li>
<li><p>The mean number of pages of all books is 500, with a standard
deviation of 200.</p></li>

<p>The linear regression line has to pass through the point (500,
15).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fewer Than 500 Pages: If “Roadside Picnic” has fewer than 500
pages, then this point is toward the left side of the pivot point of the

left corner) more than 12 does, so the slope will decrease if price
changes from -12 to 12.<br/>

<li><p>More Than 500 Pages: If “Roadside Picnic” has more than 500

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No</p>
<p>95% of bootstrapped slopes and intercepts fall within specific
intervals does not imply that 95% of predicted prices for a book with
500 pages will also fall within the interval [500a + c, 500b + d].
Because the intervals for slopes and intercepts are calculated
independently, their combination does not account for the covariance
between these regression parameters or the error variance around
predictions. Additionally, combining slope and intercept independently
can result in regression lines that do not pass through the pivotal
point (mean(X), mean(Y)), making them unreliable for accurate
prediction.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, Central
Limit Theorem, confidence interval</p>
<p>The average time to build the LAPPLAND TV storage unit is an unknown
population parameter. We’re trying to figure out if this parameter could
be equal to the specific value of 2 hours and 30 minutes. We can use the
framework we learned in class to set this up as a hypothesis test via
confidence interval. When we have a null hypothesis of the form “the
parameter equals the specific value” and an alternative hypothesis of
“it does not,” this framework applies, and conducting the hypothesis
test is equivalent to constructing a confidence interval for the
parameter and seeing if the specific value falls in the interval.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which we could construct the confidence
interval. One is through bootstrapping, and the other is through the
Central Limit Theorem, which applies in this case because our statistic
is the mean.</p>
<p>The only listed tools that could not be used here are permutation
testing and regression. Permutation testing is used to determine whether
two samples could have come from the same population, but here we only
have one sample. Permutation testing would be helpful to answer a
question like, “Does it take the same amount of time to assemble the
LAPPLAND TV storage as it does to assemble the HAUGA TV storage
unit?”</p>
<p>Regression is used to predict one numerical quantity based on
another, not to estimate a parameter as we are doing here. Regression
would be appropriate to answer a question like, “How does the assembly
time for the LAPPLAND TV storage unit change with the assembler’s
age?”</p>

<p>At a high level, we’ll start with the formula for the regression line
in standard units, and re-write it in a form that will allow us to use
the information provided to us in the question.</p>
<p>Recall, the regression line in standard units is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted }y_{\text{(su)}} = r \cdot
x_{\text{(su)}}</span></p>
<p>Using the definitions of <span class="math inline">\text{predicted
}y_{\text{(su)}}</span> and <span class="math inline">x_{\text{(su)}}</span> gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of
}y}{\text{SD of }y} = r \cdot \frac{x - \text{mean of }x}{\text{SD of
}x}</span></p>
<p>Here, the <span class="math inline">x</span> variable is sunshine
hours in January and the <span class="math inline">y</span> variable is
sunshine hours in July. Given that the standard deviation of January and
July sunshine hours are equal, we can simplifies our formula to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of }y = r
\cdot (x - \text{mean of }x)</span></p>
<p>Since we’re asked how much more sunshine Santa Clarita will have in
July compared to the average, we’re interested in the difference <span class="math inline">y - \text{mean of} y</span>. We were given that
Santa Clarita had 60 more sunshine hours in January than the average,
and that the correlation between the two variables(correlation
coefficient) is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span>. In terms
of the variables above, then, we know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">x - \text{mean of }x =
60</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">r = \frac{2}{5}</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of }y = r
\cdot (x - \text{mean of }x) = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 60 = 24</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the regression line predicts that Santa Clarita will have
24 more sunshine hours than the average California city in July.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span></p>
<p>To determine the slope of Anthony’s new regression line, we need to
understand how the modifications he made to the dataset (subtracting 5
hours from each x and y value) affect the slope. In simple linear
regression, the slope of the regression line (<span class="math inline">m</span> in <span class="math inline">y = mx +
b</span>) is calculated using the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of y}}{\text{SD
of x}}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">r</span>, the correlation coefficient
between the two variables, remains unchanged in Anthony’s modifications.
Remember, the correlation coefficient is the mean of the product of the
<span class="math inline">x</span> values and <span class="math inline">y</span> values when both are measured in standard
units; by subtracting the same constant amount from each <span class="math inline">x</span> value, we aren’t changing what the <span class="math inline">x</span> values convert to in standard units. If
you’re not convinced, convert the following two arrays in Python to
standard units; you’ll see that the results are the same.</p>
<div id="cb1" class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode py"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>x1 <span class="op">=</span> np.array([<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">8</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">9</span>])</span>

</div>
<p>Furthermore, Anthony’s modifications also don’t change the standard
deviations of the <span class="math inline">x</span> values or <span class="math inline">y</span> values, since the <span class="math inline">x</span>s and <span class="math inline">y</span>s
aren’t any more or less spread out after being shifted “down” by 5. So,
since <span class="math inline">r</span>, <span class="math inline">\text{SD of }y</span>, and <span class="math inline">\text{SD of }x</span> are all unchanged, the slope
of the new regression line is the same as the slope of the old
regression line, pre-modification!</p>
<p>Given the fact that the correlation coefficient is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span> and the standard deviation of
sunshine hours in January (<span class="math inline">\text{SD of

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 7</p>
<p>Let’s denote the original intercept as <span class="math inline">b</span> and the new intercept in the new dataset as
<span class="math inline">b'</span>. The equation for the original
regression line is <span class="math inline">y = mx + b</span>,
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">y</span> is a predicted number of sunshine
hours in July, before 5 was subtracted from each number of hours.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">m</span> is the slope of the line, which
we know is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span> from the
previous part.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">x</span> is a number of sunshine hours in
January, before 5 was subtracted from each number of hours.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">b</span> is the original intercept. This
is 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Anthony subtracts 5 from each <span class="math inline">x</span>
and <span class="math inline">y</span> value, the new regression line
becomes <span class="math display">y - 5 = m \cdot (x - 5) +
b'</span></p>
<p>Expanding and rearrange this equation, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">y = mx - 5m + 5 + b'</span></p>
<p>Remember, <span class="math inline">x</span> and <span class="math inline">y</span> here represent the number of sunshine hours
in January and July, respectively, <em>before</em> Anthony subtracted 5
from each number of hours. This means that the equation for <span class="math inline">y</span> above is equivalent to <span class="math inline">y = mx + b</span>. Comparing, we see that</p>
<p><span class="math display">-5m + 5 + b' = b</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">m = \frac{2}{5}</span> (from the
previous part) and <span class="math inline">b = 10</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">-5 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 5 + b' = 10
\implies b' = 10 - 5 + 2 = 7</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the intercept of Anthony’s new regression line is 7.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 24</p>
<p>At a high level, we’ll start with the formula for the regression line
in standard units, and re-write it in a form that will allow us to use
the information provided to us in the question.</p>
<p>Recall, the regression line in standard units is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted }y_{\text{(su)}} = r \cdot
x_{\text{(su)}}</span></p>
<p>Using the definitions of <span class="math inline">\text{predicted
}y_{\text{(su)}}</span> and <span class="math inline">x_{\text{(su)}}</span> gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of
}y}{\text{SD of }y} = r \cdot \frac{x - \text{mean of }x}{\text{SD of
}x}</span></p>
<p>Here, the <span class="math inline">x</span> variable is sunshine
hours in January and the <span class="math inline">y</span> variable is
sunshine hours in July. Given that the standard deviation of January and
July sunshine hours are equal, we can simplifies our formula to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of }y = r
\cdot (x - \text{mean of }x)</span></p>
<p>Since we’re asked how much more sunshine Santa Clarita will have in
July compared to the average, we’re interested in the difference <span class="math inline">y - \text{mean of} y</span>. We were given that
Santa Clarita had 60 more sunshine hours in January than the average,
and that the correlation between the two variables(correlation
coefficient) is <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{5}</span>. In terms
of the variables above, then, we know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">x - \text{mean of }x =
60</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">r = \frac{2}{5}</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of }y = r
\cdot (x - \text{mean of }x) = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 60 = 24</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the regression line predicts that Santa Clarita will have
24 more sunshine hours than the average California city in July.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: A distinctive pattern in the residual
plot</p>
<p>We’re told in the problem that the number of sunshine hours per month
in Chicago increases from the winter (January) to the summer
(July/August) and then decreases again to the winter (December). Here’s
a real plot of this data; we don’t need real data to answer this
question, but this is the kind of plot you could sketch out in the exam
given the description in the question. (The gold shaded area is
irrelevant for our purposes.)</p>
<center>
<a href="https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,Chicago,United-States-of-America"><img alt="Average monthly sunhours in Chicago, the United States of America" border="0" src="https://weather-and-climate.com/uploads/average-sunshine-united-states-of-america-chicago.png"/></a>
</center>
<p>The points in this plot aren’t tightly clustered around a straight
line, and that’s because there’s a non-linear relationship between month
and number of sunshine hours. As such, when we draw a straight line
through this scatter plot, it won’t be able to fully capture the
relationship being shown. It’ll likely start off in the bottom left and
increase to the top right, which will lead to the sunshine hours for
summer months being underestimated and the sunshine hours for later
winter months (November, December) being overestimated. This will lead
to a distinctive pattern in our residual plot, which means that linear
regression as-is isn’t the right tool for modeling this data (because
ideally, the residual plot would be a patternless cloud of points).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Option 3.</p>
<p>The largest slope out of these four options will be the slope that
represents the greatest increase in y-units per x-unit: <span class="math display">m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</span>.</p>
<p>Option 1, which predicts <code>"Rent"</code> from
<code>"Sqft"</code>, has large values for its y-variable
(<code>"Rent"</code>), but also has large values for its x-variable
(<code>"Sqft"</code>). The resulting slope is not that big, as it is a
fraction of large values over large values.</p>
<p>Option 2, which predicts <code>"Sqft"</code> from
<code>"Rent"</code>, is also not that big of a slope for the same
reasons as Option 1 (slope is a fraction of large values over large
values).</p>
<p>Option 3, which predicts <code>"Rent"</code> from <code>"Bed"</code>,
has large values for its y-variable (<code>"Rent"</code>), but has small
values for its x-variable (<code>"Bed"</code>). The resulting slope is
incredibly big, as it is a fraction of large values over small
values.</p>
<p>Option 4, which predicts <code>"Bed"</code> from <code>"Rent"</code>,
has small values for its y-variable (<code>"Bed"</code>), but has large
values for its x-variable (<code>"Rent"</code>). The resulting slope is
incredibly small, as it is a fraction of small values over large
values.</p>
<p>Of all four options, Option 3 is the largest slope.</p>

<p>Suppose the <strong>distance</strong> of a Tour de France stage and

associated with correlation coefficient <span class="math inline">r =

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 3 hours</p>
<p>We know that <span class="math inline">\bar{x} = 200</span>, <span class="math inline">\sigma_x</span> = 80, <span class="math inline">r =

this problem we are given <span class="math inline">x = 160</span> and
<span class="math inline">y = 5</span>. In order to find the standard

<p><span class="math display">x_{su} = \frac{160-200}{80} =

<p>Stages in the middle of the Tour tend to be longer than those at the

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span>
hours longer.</p>
<p>Since we are interested in how much longer stage 14 is than stage 20
based on this linear association, we first want to calculate the slope.
Note that <span class="math inline">r=\frac{2}{3}</span>, <span class="math inline">\text{SD}_y=1.5</span>, and <span class="math inline">\text{SD}_x=80</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">m = r \cdot

<p><span class="math display">m = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1.5}{80} =
\frac{1}{80}</span></p>
<p>This means that for every additional 1km, time increases by <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{80}</span>.</p>
<p>Since Stage 14 is 60km longer than Stage 20, we simply multiply our
slope by <span class="math inline">60</span>, giving <span class="math inline">\frac{60}{80} = \frac{3}{4}</span>. Thus we expect

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It would stay the same.</p>
<p>Adding a 30 minute break to all the stages simply increases each
stage’s time by an additional 30 minutes. This would not change the
slope since adding time simply shifts the time data points right, but
doesn’t change the relationship between distance and time.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> hypothesis testing</p>
<p>The question at hand is dealing with differences between sales of
different flavors of ice cream, which is the same thing as the total of
ice cream cones sold. We can use hypothesis testing to test our null
hypothesis that the count of Vanilla cones sold is higher than
Chocolate, and our alternative hypothesis that the count of Chocolate
cones sold is more than Vanilla. A permutation test is not suitable here
because we are not comparing any numerical quantity associated with each
group. A permutation test could be used to answer questions like “Are
chocolate ice cream cones more expensive than vanilla ice cream cones?”
or “Do chocolate ice cream cones have more calories than vanilla ice
cream cones?”, or any other question where you are tracking a number
(cost or calories) along with each ice cream cone. In our case, however,
we are not tracking a number along with each individual ice cream cone,
but instead tracking a total of ice cream cones sold.</p>
<p>An analogy to this hypothesis test can be found in the “fair or
unfair coin” problem in Lectures 20 and 21, where our null hypothesis is
that the coin is fair and our alternative hypothesis is that the coin is
unfair. The “fairness” of the coin is not a numerical quantity that we
can track with each individual coin flip, just like how the count of ice
cream cones sold is not a numerical quantity that we can track with each
individual ice cream cone.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 79.20</p>
<p>To answer this question, first find the z score for a table of 5
people. Z = (5-3)/1 = 2. Now having this Z score, find the price that
correlated in the bill distribution by finding the value for 2 standard
deviations larger than the mean while also accounting for the
correlation between the two variables. This is calculated with mean +
((Z<em>SD) </em> r) which is 60 + ((12 * 2) * 0.8) = 79.20.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could solve for the regression line and plug our
values in according to the reference sheet:</p>
<p>m = (0.8) * (12/1) and b = 60 - (48/5) * 3 (where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept)</p>
<p>Thus plugging the appropriate values in our regression line
yields</p>

\cdot x_{\text{(su)}}</span></p>
<p>We know that to convert a value to standard units, we subtract the
value by the mean of the column it came from, and divide by the standard
deviation of the column it came from. As such, <span class="math inline">x_{\text{(su)}} = \frac{x - \text{mean of }
x}{\text{SD of } x}</span>. We can substitute this relationship in the
regression line above, which gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of
} y}{\text{SD of } y} = r \cdot \frac{x - \text{mean of } x}{\text{SD of
} x}</span></p>
<p>To simplify things, let’s use what we were told. We were told that
the predicted <code>"Rating"</code> was 3 points higher than average.
This means that the numerator of the left side, <span class="math inline">\text{predicted } y - \text{mean of } y</span>, is
equal to 3. Similarly, we were told that the <code>"Complexity"</code>
was 2 points higher than average, so <span class="math inline">x -
\text{mean of } x</span> is 2. Then, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{3}{\text{SD of } y} =
\frac{2r}{\text{SD of }x}</span></p>
<p>Note that for convenience, we included <span class="math inline">r</span> in the numerator on the right-hand
side.</p>
<p>Remember that our goal is to compare the SD of <code>"Rating"</code>
(<span class="math inline">y</span>) to the SD of
<code>"Complexity"</code> (<span class="math inline">x</span>). We now
have an equation that relates these two quantities! Since they’re both
currently on the denominator, which can be tricky to work with, let’s
take the reciprocal (i.e. “flip”) both fractions.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{\text{SD of } y}{3} = \frac{\text{SD
of }x}{2r}</span></p>
<p>Now, re-arranging gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{SD of } y \cdot \frac{2r}{3} =
\text{SD of }x</span></p>
<p>Since we know that <span class="math inline">r</span> is somewhere
between 0 and 1, we know that <span class="math inline">\frac{2r}{3}</span> is somewhere between 0 and <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{3}</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\text{SD of } x</span> is somewhere between 0 and
two-thirds of the value of <span class="math inline">\text{SD of }
y</span>, which means that no matter what, <span class="math inline">\text{SD of } x &lt; \text{SD of } y</span>.
Remembering again that here <code>"Complexity"</code> is our <span class="math inline">x</span> and <code>"Rating"</code> is our <span class="math inline">y</span>, we have that the SD of
<code>"Complexity"</code> is less than the SD of
<code>"Rating"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">r &gt;

<p>To answer this problem, it’s useful to recall the regression line in
standard units:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} = r
\cdot x_{\text{(su)}}</span></p>
<p>If a value is positive in standard units, it means that it is above
the average of the distribution that it came from, and if a value is
negative in standard units, it means that it is below the average of the
distribution that it came from. Since we’re told that <em>Wingspan</em>
has a <code>"Complexity"</code> that is 2 points higher than the
average, we know that <span class="math inline">x_{\text{(su)}}</span>
is positive. Since we’re told that the predicted <code>"Rating"</code>
is 3 points higher than the average, we know that <span class="math inline">\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}}</span> must also
be positive. As a result, <span class="math inline">r</span> must also
be positive, since you can’t multiply a positive number (<span class="math inline">x_{\text{(su)}}</span>) by a negative number and end
up with another positive number.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> SD of <code>"Complexity"</code> &lt; SD of
<code>"Rating"</code></p>
<p>Since the distance of the predicted <code>"Rating"</code> from its
average is larger than the distance of the <code>"Complexity"</code>
from its average, it might be reasonable to guess that the values in the
<code>"Rating"</code> column are more spread out. This is true, but
let’s see concretely why that’s the case.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the equation of the regression line in standard
units from the previous subpart. Remember that here, <span class="math inline">x</span> refers to <code>"Complexity"</code> and
<span class="math inline">y</span> refers to <code>"Rating"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 3.1</p>
<p>Let’s recall the formulas for the regression line in original units,
since we’re given information in original units in this question (such
as the fact that for a <code>"Play Time"</code> of 8
<strong>minutes</strong>, the predicted <code>"Rating"</code> is 4
stars). Remember that throughout this question, <code>"Play Time"</code>
is our <span class="math inline">x</span> and <code>"Rating"</code> is
our <span class="math inline">y</span>.</p>
<p>The regression line is of the form <span class="math inline">y = mx +
b</span>, where</p>
<p><span class="math display">m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of }
y}{\text{SD of }x}, b = \text{mean of }y - m \cdot \text{mean of }
x</span></p>
<p>There’s a lot of information provided to us in the question – let’s
think about what it means in the context of our <span class="math inline">x</span>s and <span class="math inline">y</span>s.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first piece is that <span class="math inline">r</span> is
negative, so <span class="math inline">-1 \leq r &lt; 0</span>.</li>
<li>The second piece is that <span class="math inline">\text{SD of } x =
2 \cdot (\text{SD of } y)</span>. Equivalently, we can say that <span class="math inline">\frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of } x} =
\frac{1}{2}</span>. This form is convenient, because it’s close to the
definition of the slope of the regression line, <span class="math inline">m</span>. Using this fact, the slope of the
regression line is <span class="math inline">m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD
of } y}{\text{SD of }x} = r \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{r}{2}</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\text{mean of } x</span> is 10. This
means that the intercept of the regression line, <span class="math inline">b</span>, is <span class="math inline">b =
\text{mean of }y - m \cdot \text{mean of } x = \text{mean of }y -
\frac{r}{2} \cdot 10 = \text{mean of }y - 5r</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">x</span> is 8, the predicted <span class="math inline">y</span> is 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all of this information, we need to find possible values for
the <span class="math inline">\text{mean of } y</span>. Substituting our
known values for <span class="math inline">m</span> and <span class="math inline">b</span> into <span class="math inline">y = mx +
b</span> gives us</p>
<p><span class="math display">y = \frac{r}{2} x + \text{mean of }y -
5r</span></p>
<p>Now, using the fact that if if <span class="math inline">x =
8</span>, the predicted <span class="math inline">y</span> is 4, we
have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}4 &amp;= \frac{r}{2} \cdot 8
+ \text{mean of }y - 5r\\4 &amp;= 4r - 5r + \text{mean of }y\\ 4 + r
&amp;= \text{mean of} y\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Cool! We now know that the <span class="math inline">\text{mean of }
y</span> is <span class="math inline">4 + r</span>. We know that <span class="math inline">r</span> must satisfy the relationship <span class="math inline">-1 \leq r &lt; 0</span>. By adding 4 to all pieces
of this inequality, we have that <span class="math inline">3 \leq r + 4
&lt; 4</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">3 \leq
\text{mean of } y &lt; 4</span>. Of the four options provided, only one
is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 4, which is 3.1.</p>
