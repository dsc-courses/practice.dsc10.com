<p>This exam was administered in-person. The exam was closed-notes, except students were provided a copy of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQApk9Ovdi-QVqMgnNcq5dZcWucUKoG-/view?usp=sharing">DSC 10 Reference Sheet</a>. No calculators were allowed. Students had <strong>3 hours</strong> to take this exam.</p>
<hr />
<p>Credit cards allow consumers to make purchases by borrowing money and paying it back later. Credit card companies are wary of granting this borrowing ability to consumers who may not be able to pay back their debt. Therefore, potential credit card carriers must submit an application that contains information about themselves and their history of paying back debt.</p>
<p>The DataFrame <code>apps</code> contains application data for a random sample of 1,000 applicants for a particular credit card from the 1990s. The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>"status" (str)</code>: Whether the credit card application was approved: <code>"approved"</code> or <code>"denied"</code> values only.</p></li>
<li><p><code>"age" (float)</code>: The applicant’s age, in years, to the nearest twelfth of a year.</p></li>
<li><p><code>"income" (float)</code>: The applicant’s annual income, in tens of thousands of dollars.</p></li>
<li><p><code>"homeowner" (str)</code>: Whether the credit card applicant owns their own home: <code>"yes"</code> or <code>"no"</code> values only.</p></li>
<li><p><code>"dependents" (int)</code>: The number of dependents, or individuals that rely on the applicant as a primary source of income, such as children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first few rows of <code>apps</code> are shown below, though remember that <code>apps</code> has 1,000 rows.</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/fa22-final/apps.jpg' width=45%></center>
<p><strong>Throughout this exam, we will refer to <code>apps</code> repeatedly.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each applicant only submitted a single application.</p></li>
<li><p>We have already run <code>import babypandas as bpd</code> and <code>import numpy as np</code>.</p></li>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>Question goes here</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-2.1">Problem 2.1</h3>
<p>In our implementation of this permutation test, we followed the procedure outlined in lecture to draw new pairs of samples under the null hypothesis and compute test statistics — that is, we randomly assigned each row to a group (approved or denied) by shuffling one of the columns in , then computed the test statistic on this random pair of samples.</p>
<p>Let’s now explore an alternative solution to drawing pairs of samples under the null hypothesis and computing test statistics. Here’s the approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Shuffle, i.e. re-order, the rows of the DataFrame.</li>
<li>Use the values at the top of the resulting <code>"dependents"</code> column as the new “denied” sample, and the values at the at the bottom of the resulting <code>"dependents"</code> column as the new “approved” sample. Note that we don’t necessarily split the DataFrame exactly in half — the sizes of these new samples depend on the number of “denied” and “approved” values in the original DataFrame!</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we generate our pair of random samples in this way, we’ll compute the test statistic on the random pair, as usual. Here, we’ll use as our test statistic the difference between the mean number of dependents for denied and approved applicants, in the order <strong>denied minus approved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fill in the blanks to complete the simulation below.</strong></p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> <code>np.random.permutation</code> shouldn’t appear anywhere in your code.</p>

<p><strong>Anwser: </strong></p>
<p>Blank A: <code>df.sample(df.shape[0])</code></p>
<p>Blank B: <code>df.take(np.arange(denied))</code></p>
<p>Blank C: <code>df.take(np.arange(denied+1, df.shape[0]))</code></p>
<p><strong>For the blank A</strong>, the function wants to return a DataFrame with the same number of rows (the size of our sample), but wants these rows reordered. Note that the actual rows will be the same, so we want to sample without replacement (having only one instance of each row in the old dataframe in the new dataframe). Baby Pandas provides the <code>.sample</code> method for this question. <code>.sample</code> will sample dataframe rows where the first argument is the amount of samples, and the second (optional) argument is whether or not we want to conduct sampling with replacement. As mentioned previously, we want the same number of rows which we can find using <code>df.shape[0]</code> and do this sampling without replacement (the default behavior so we do not have to specify).</p>
<p><strong>For blank B</strong>, when we want to conduct a permutation test, the idea is to shuffle and combine the values in two different groups. In this function the <code>denied</code> variable is the number of dependents values we need to take for our new sample of “denied” applicants. To find the mean number of denied, we want to use <code>df.take(np.arange(denied))</code> to get the correct number of denied applicants while also conducting shuffling.</p>
<p><strong>For blank C</strong>, the logic falls similar to the logic mentioned above. Instead of denied applicants, we are now looking at the approved applicants. To account for the number of approved applicants, we can use <code>df.take(np.arange(denied+1, df.shape[0]))</code> which accounts for the number of approved applicants (while also considering shuffling) since it starts at <code>denied+1</code> to the end of the dataframe (which is found using <code>df.shape[0]</code>).</p>

<h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h2>
<p>In this question, we’ll explore the relationship between the ages and incomes of credit card applicants.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.1">Problem 4.1</h3>
<p>The credit card company that owns the data in apps, BruinCard, has decided not to give us access to the entire <code>apps</code> DataFrame, but instead just a sample of <code>apps</code> called <code>small apps</code>. We’ll start by using the information in <code>small_apps</code> to compute the regression line that predicts the age of an applicant given their income. For an applicant with an income that is 8/3 standard deviations above the mean income, we predict their age to be 4/5 standard deviations above the mean age. What is the correlation coefficient, <code>r</code>, between incomes and ages in small apps? Give your answer as a <strong>fully simplified fraction</strong>.</p>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Anwser:</strong> 3/10</p>
<p>To find the correlation coefficient <code>r</code> we can express the relationship as y = * or 4/5 = r * 8/3. Rewriting this expression and solving for r, we get 12/40 which can be simplified as 3/10.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.2">Problem 4.2</h3>
<p>Now, we want to predict the income of an applicant given their age. We will again use the information in small apps to find the regression line. The regression line predicts that an applicant whose age is 4/5 standard deviations above the mean age has an income that is s standard deviations above the mean income. What is the value of <code>s</code>? Give your answer as a <strong>fully simplified fraction</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Anwser:</strong> 6/25</p>
<p>We can simply find the value of s by taking the given 4/5 standard deviation and multiplying by our found value for r. As explained above, we compute a value of 3/10, so taking 3/10 * 4/5 we get 6/25.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.3">Problem 4.3</h3>
<p>BruinCard has now taken away our access to both apps and small apps, and has instead given us access to an even smaller sample of apps called mini apps. In mini apps, we know the following information: - All incomes and ages are positive numbers. - There is a positive linear association between incomes and ages.</p>
<p>We use the data in <code>mini apps</code> to find the regression line that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant given their age. Just to test the limits of this regression line, we use it to predict the income of an applicant who is <strong>-2</strong> years old, even though it doesn’t make sense for a person to have a negative age.</p>
<p>Let <code>I</code> be the regression line’s prediction of this applicant’s income. Which of the following inequalities are guaranteed to be satisfied? Select all that apply.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" /> <code>I</code> &lt; 0</p></li>

<p><strong>Anwser:</strong> Options 2 and 4</p>
<p>To understand this response, we will investigate each response.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> The question asks about the prediction of the regression for an applicant who is -2 years old. The first response essentially is saying that the income is guaranteed to be negative. This is not always true. For example, if the y intercept is 10, and the slop is 2, we would still predict a positive income (6) for a -2 year old applicant.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> This option essentially is asking if the predicted value will guaranteed to be lower than the mean income. In the problem it is given that there is a positive linear association between income and ages, so we know that as we get closer to the mean ,which will be greater than -2 since the bounds of the regression are all positive, values will get greater than greater. Using this knowledge, we can guarantee that the prediction for a -2 year old applicant (<code>I</code>) will be less than the mean income.</p>
<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> This option is essentially saying the difference between our prediction and the mean income will be less than the mean age + 2. This anwser cannot be guaranteed simply because we cannot make any assumptions about how the distributions of mean income and mean age are related without converting to standard units.</p>
<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> This option is essentially the same as option 3, but accounts for the fact we have to convert to standard units (by diving by the std for each variable). Through converting to standard units, we know that the equality must hold.</p>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.4">Problem 4.4</h3>
<p>Yet again, BruinCard, the company that gave us access to apps, small apps, and mini apps, has revoked our access to those three DataFrames and instead has given us micro apps, an even smaller sample of apps. Using micro apps, we are again interested in finding the regression line that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant given their age. We are given the following information: - The correlation coefficient, <code>r</code>, between ages and incomes is −1/3 (note the negative sign). - The mean income is 7/2 remember, incomes are measured in tens of thousands of dollars). - The mean age is 33. - The regression line predicts that a 24 year old applicant has an income of 31/2.</p>
<p>Suppose the standard deviation of incomes in micro apps is an integer multiple of the standard deviation of ages in micro apps. That is, <code>standard deviation of income = k · standard deviation of age</code>. What is the value of <code>k</code>? Give your answer as an integer.</p>

<p><strong>Anwser:</strong> 4</p>
<p>To find this anwser, we can relate the std of x and std of y. That is, using the information provided in the problem we can take ((24-33) / std. x) * -1/3 and relate this to (31/2 - 7/2) / Std. y. Simplifying this expression, we can get 9/(3 * std. x)= 12/std. y. From cross multiplication and simplification, we can derive stdy = (36/9) * stdx which is 4 * stdx. Therefore, the std. of x is 4 times as large as the std. of y, so k = 4.</p>
