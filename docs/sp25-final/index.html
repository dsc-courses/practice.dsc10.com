of double-sided handwritten notes. No calculators were allowed. Students
had <strong>3 hours</strong> to take this exam.</p>

<p><em>The Hunger Games</em> is a young adult dystopian fictional novel.
The events take place in the future in the fictional country of Panem,
which consists of 12 impoverished districts and a wealthy metropolitan
area called the Capitol.</p>
<p>The plot centers around an annual televised competition called the
Hunger Games, in which children from the districts are forced to compete
in a battle to the death. The participants, called tributes, are
randomly selected via a lottery system.</p>
<p>The competition takes place in an arena that is specially designed
for this purpose, and usually lasts several days or weeks, until only
one tribute survives. The entire event is turned into a spectacle, which
is broadcast throughout Panem as a way for the oppressive government to
remind district residents of their powerlessness.</p>
<p>The main character and protagonist of <em>The Hunger Games</em> is
Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year old girl from District 12 who competes in
the 74th annual Hunger Games. After a life of poverty and near
starvation, her experience in the Hunger Games arena further fuels her
hatred of the government and lights a fire in her to fight back against
the oppression.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<p>In an annual ceremony known as the reaping, tributes are selected to
represent their district in the Hunger Games. One male and one female
tribute from each district are randomly selected via a lottery
drawing.</p>
<p>Every child between the ages of <span class="math inline">12</span>
and <span class="math inline">18</span> (inclusive) has tickets entered
into the drawing for their sex and district (e.g.¬†girls from District
<span class="math inline">12</span>). The number of tickets entered is
dependent on age.</p>
<p>Starting at age <span class="math inline">12</span>, each child
receives one ticket in the lottery. For each year after that, they
receive one additional ticket, added to the total from the previous
year. For example, <span class="math inline">13</span>-year-olds have
two tickets, <span class="math inline">14</span>-year-olds have three
tickets, and so on.</p>
<p>In this problem, we will consider only tickets corresponding to girls
from District <span class="math inline">12</span>, and look at the
distribution of these tickets according to the age of the person they
represent. A density histogram for these tickets is shown below.</p>

<p>Suppose the rules of the Hunger Games were changed to eliminate <span
class="math inline">18</span>-year-olds. If we plotted a new density
histogram of the distribution of ages for tickets corresponding to girls
from District <span class="math inline">12</span> aged <span
class="math inline">12</span> to <span class="math inline">17</span>,
how would the height of the <code>[13, 14)</code> bar change?</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">h</span> be the height of this bar in
the original histogram. Give its height in the new histogram in terms of
<span class="math inline">h</span>.</p>
