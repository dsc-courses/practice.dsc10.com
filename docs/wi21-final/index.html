<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<p>One way to use <code>np.arange</code> to produce the sequence
<code>[2, 6, 10, 14]</code> is <code>np.arange(2, 15, 4)</code>. This
gives three inputs to np.arange.</p>
<p>Fill in the blanks below to show a different way to produce the same
sequence, this time using only one input to np.arange. Each blank below
must be filled in with a single number only, and the final result,
<code>x*np.arange(y)+z</code>, must produce the sequence
<code>[2, 6, 10, 14]</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>x*np.arange(y)+z</code> fill in the missing values:</p>
<p><code>x = _</code></p>
<p><code>y = _</code></p>
<p><code>z = _</code></p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p><code>x = 4</code>, <code>y = 4</code>, <code>z = 2</code></p>
<p>The question states that we are trying to create the sequence
<code>[2, 6, 10, 14]</code> by filling in the blanks for the statement
<code>x*np.arange(y)+z</code>. If we look at the sequence we are
attempting to derive, we can see that each step in the sequence
increments by 4. Similarly, we can see that the sequence begins at 2. We
know that passing an argument by itself in <code>np.arange</code> will
increment up to that number (for example <code>np.arange(4)</code> will
produce the sequence <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>). Knowing this, we can
create this sequence by setting y to 4. Attempting to reach the desired
sequence of <code>[2, 6, 10, 14]</code> from <code>[0, 1, 2, 3]</code>
we can multiply each number by 4 by setting x to 4 and instantiate the
sequence at 2 by setting z as 2.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>The command <code>.set_index</code> can take as input one column, to
be used as the index, or a sequence of columns to be used as a nested
index (sometimes called a MultiIndex). A MultiIndex is the default
behavior of the dataframe returned by .groupby with multiple
columns.</p>
<p>You are given a dataframe called restaurants that contains
information on a variety of local restaurants’ daily number of customers
and daily income. There is a row for each restaurant for each date in a
given five-year time period.</p>
<p>The columns of restaurants are <code>'name'</code>
(<code>str</code>), <code>'year'</code> (<code>int</code>),
<code>'month'</code> (<code>int</code>), <code>'day'</code>
(<code>int</code>), <code>'num_diners'</code> (<code>int</code>), and
<code>'income'</code> (<code>float</code>).</p>
<p>Assume that in our data set, there are not two different restaurants
that go by the same name (chain restaurants, for example).</p>
<p>Which of the following would be the best way to set the index for
this dataset?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> <code>restaurants.set_index('name')</code></p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> <code>restaurants.set_index(['year', 'month', 'day'])</code></p></li>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
<code>restaurants.set_index(['name', 'year', 'month', 'day'])</code></p>
<p>The correct answer is to create an index with the
<code>'name'</code>, <code>'year'</code>, ‘<code>month</code>’, and
‘<code>day</code>’ columns. The question provides that there is a row
for each restaurant for each data in the five year span. Therefore, we
are interested in the granularity of a specific day (the day, the month,
and the year). In order to have this information available in this
index, we must set the index to be a multi index with columns
<code>['name', 'year', 'month', 'day']</code>. Looking at the other
options, simply looking at the <code>'name'</code> column would not
account for the fact the dataframe contains daily data on customers and
income for each restaurant. Similarly, the second option of
<code>['name', 'month', 'day']</code> would not account for the fact
that the data comes in a five year span so there will naturally be five
overlaps (one for each year) for each unique date that must be accounted
for.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> not enough information to tell</p>
<p>The question does not provide enough information to know the
resulting table size with certainty. When merging two tables together,
the tables can be merged with a inner, left, right, and outer join. Each
of these joins will produce a different amount of rows. Since the
question does not provide the type of join, it is impossible to tell the
resulting table size.</p>

<p>You sample from a population by assigning each element of the
population a number starting with 1. You include element 1 in your
sample. Then you generate a random number, <code>n</code>, between 2 and
5, inclusive, and you take every <code>n</code>th element after element
1 to be in your sample. For example, if you select <code>n=2</code>,
then your sample will be elements <code>1, 3, 5, 7</code>, and so
on.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> True</p>
<p>The answer is true since someone can easily sketch each sample to
view the probability of selecting a certain subset. For example, when n
= 2 we know the elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. Similarly we know
this information for n = 3, 4 and 5. Using this information we could
calculate the probability of selecting a subset.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> False</p>
<p>No, each subset of the population is not equally likely to be
selected since the element assigned as element 1 will always be selected
due to the way sampling is conducted as defined in the question. That
is, the question says we always include element one in the sample which
will over represent it in samples as compared to other parts of the
population.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> <code>1</code></p>
<p>The output will return 1. Notice that the final function call is to
<code>.shape[1]</code>. We know that <code>.shape[1]</code> is a call to
see how many columns are in the resulting data frame. When we group by
publication year, there is only one column that will be aggregated by
the groupby call (which is the <code>'num_chapters'</code> column). The
other columns are string, and therefore, will not be aggregated in the
groupby call (since you can’t take the mean of a string). Consequently
<code>.shape[1]</code> will only result one column for the mean of the
<code>'num_chapters'</code> column.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> do two queries to get two separate tables
(one for each of “Dean Koontz” and “Charles Dickens”), use
<code>get</code> on the <code>'num_chapters'</code> column of each
table, use the Series method <code>.mean()</code> on each, compute the
absolute value of the difference in these two means</p>
<p>Logically, we want to somehow separate data for author “Dean Koontz”
and “Charles Dickens”. (If we don’t we’ll be taking a mean that includes
the chapters of books from both authors.) To achieve this separation, we
can create two separate tables with a query that specifies a value on
the <code>'author'</code> column. Now having two separate tables, we can
aggregate on the <code>'num_chapters'</code> (the column of interest).
To get the <code>'num_chapters'</code> column we can use the
<code>get</code> method. To actually acquire the mean of the
<code>'num_chapters'</code> column we can evoke the <code>.mean()</code>
call. </p>

unique book title (the first response) and check for each unique other

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 0.007742</p>
<p>Taking the area of the bin <code>[20,45]</code> we can find the
number of art galleries already within this bin 0.0055 * 25 = 0.1375
(estimation based on the visualization). To find the number take this
proportion x the total number of art galleries. 0.1375 * 29 = about 4
art galleries. If we add two art galleries to this total we get 4 art
galleries in the <code>[20,45]</code> bin to get 6 art galleries. To
find the frequency of 6 art galleries to the entire data set we can take
6/31. Note that the question asks for the <em>height</em> of the bin.
Therefore, we can take (6/31) / 25 due to the size of the bin which will
give an answer of 0.007742 upon rounding to six decimal places.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> a DataFrame with 10 rows, where no two rows
can be the same</p>
<p>Looking at the documentation for <code>.sample()</code> we can see
that it accepts a few arguments. The first argument specifies the number
of rows (which is why we specify 10). The next argument is a boolean
that specifies if the sampling happens with or without replacement. By
default, the sampling will occur without replacement (which happens in
this question since no argument is specified so the default is evoked).
Looking at the return, we can see that since we are sampling a
dataframe, a dataframe will also be returned which is why a DataFrame
with 10 rows, where no two rows can be the same is correct.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> it will become wider</p>
<p>By increasing the number of random process we increase the possible
range of values from 500 to 5000. The statistic being calculated is the
count of how many times a phenomenon occurs. If the number of random
process increases 10x the statistic can now take values ranging from
<code>[0, 5000]</code> instead of <code>[0, 500]</code> which will
clearly make the histogram width wider (due to the wider range of values
it can take).</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 0.48</p>
<p>This problem is testing our understanding of the Central Limit
Theorem and normal distributions. Recall, the Central Limit Theorem
tells us that the distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal,
with the following characteristics:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
\text{Mean of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &amp;=
\text{Population Mean} = 50 \\
\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &amp;=
\frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} =
\frac{15}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.5
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>Given this information, it may be easier to express the problem as
“We draw a value from a normal distribution with mean 50 and SD 1.5.
What is the probability that the value is between 50 and 53?” Note that
this probability is equal to the <strong>proportion of values between 50
and 53</strong> in a normal distribution whose mean is 50 and 1.5 (since
probabilities can be thought of as proportions).</p>
<p>In class, we typically worked with the <em>standard</em> normal
distribution, in which the mean was 0, the SD was 1, and the <span class="math inline">x</span>-axis represented values in standard units.
Let’s convert the quantities of interest in this problem to standard
units, keeping in mind that the mean and SD we’re using now are the mean
and SD of the distribution of possible sample means, not of the
population.</p>
<ul>
<li>50 converted to standard units is <span class="math inline">\frac{50
- \text{mean}}{\text{SD}} = \frac{50 - 50}{1.5} = 0</span> (no
calculation was necessary – 0 in standard units is equal to the mean in
original units).</li>
<li>53 converted to standard units is <span class="math inline">\frac{53
- \text{mean}}{\text{SD}} = \frac{53 - 50}{1.5} = 2</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, our problem boils down to finding the <strong>proportion of
values in a standard normal distribution that are between 0 and
2</strong>, or <strong>the proportion of values in a normal distribution
that are in the interval <span class="math inline">[\text{mean},
\text{mean} + 2 \text{ SDs}]</span></strong>.</p>
<p>From class, we know that in a normal distribution, roughly 95% of
values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean, i.e. the proportion
of values in the interval <span class="math inline">[\text{mean} - 2
\text{ SDs}, \text{mean} + 2 \text{ SDs}]</span> is 0.95.</p>
<center><img src="../assets/images/wi21-final/normal-solution.png" width="50%"/></center>
<p>Since the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, half of
the values in this interval are to the right of the mean, and half are
to the left. This means that the proportion of values in the interval
<span class="math inline">[\text{mean}, \text{mean} + 2 \text{
SDs}]</span> is <span class="math inline">\frac{0.95}{2} = 0.475</span>,
which rounds to 0.48, and thus the desired result is 0.48.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 625</p>
<p><em>Note: Before reviewing these solutions, it’s highly recommended
to revisit the lecture on “Choosing Sample Sizes,” since this problem
follows the main example from that lecture almost exactly.</em></p>
<p>While this solution is long, keep in mind from the start that our
goal is to solve for the <strong>smallest sample size necessary</strong>
to create a confidence interval that achieves certain criteria.</p>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the distribution of the
sample mean is roughly normal, regardless of the distribution of the
population from which the samples are drawn. At first, it may not be
clear how the Central Limit Theorem is relevant, but remember that
proportions are means too – for instance, the proportion of adults who
want to be vaccinated is equal to the mean of a collection of 1s and 0s,
where we have a 1 for each adult that wants to be vaccinated and a 0 for
each adult who doesn’t want to be vaccinated. What this means (😉) is
that <strong>the Central Limit Theorem applies to the distribution of
the sample proportion, so we can use it here too</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only do we know that the distribution of sample proportions is
roughly normal, but we know its mean and standard deviation, too:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
\text{Mean of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &amp;=
\text{Population Mean} = \text{Population Proportion} \\
\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &amp;=
\frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>Using this information, we can create a 95% confidence interval for
the population proportion, using the fact that in a normal distribution,
roughly 95% of values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\left[ \text{Population Proportion} - 2
\cdot \frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}, \:
\text{Population Proportion} + 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Population
SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}  \right]</span></p>
<p>However, this interval depends on the population proportion (mean)
and SD, which we don’t know. (If we did know these parameters, there
would be no need to collect a sample!) Instead, we’ll use the sample
proportion and SD as rough estimates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\left[ \text{Sample Proportion} - 2 \cdot
\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}, \: \text{Sample
Proportion} + 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample
Size}}}  \right]</span></p>
<p>Note that the width of this interval – that is, its right endpoint
minus its left endpoint – is: <span class="math display">\text{width} =
4 \cdot \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}</span></p>
<p>In the problem, we’re told that we want our interval to be accurate
to within 0.04, which is equivalent to wanting the width of our interval
to be less than or equal to 0.08 (since the interval extends the same
amount above and below the sample proportion). As such, we need to pick
the <strong>smallest sample size necessary</strong> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\text{width} = 4 \cdot \frac{\text{Sample
SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} \leq 0.08</span></p>
<p>We can re-arrange the inequality above to solve for our sample’s
size:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
4 \cdot \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} &amp;\leq
0.08 \\
\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} &amp;\leq 0.02 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} &amp;\leq \frac{0.02}{\text{Sample
SD}} \\
\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{0.02} &amp;\leq \sqrt{\text{Sample Size}} \\
\left( \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{0.02} \right)^2 &amp;\leq \text{Sample
Size}
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>All we now need to do is pick the smallest sample size that satisfies
the above inequality. But there’s an issue – <strong>we don’t know what
our sample SD is, because we haven’t collected our sample</strong>!
Notice that in the inequality above, as the sample SD increases, so does
the minimum necessary sample size. In order to ensure we don’t collect
too small of a sample (which would result in the width of our confidence
interval being <em>larger</em> than desired), we can use an upper bound
for the SD of our sample. In the problem, we’re told that the largest
possible SD of a sample of 0s and 1s is 0.5 – this means that if we
replace our sample SD with 0.5, we will find a sample size such that the
width of our confidence interval is guaranteed to be less than or equal
to 0.08. This sample size may be larger than necessary, but that’s
better than it being smaller than necessary.</p>
<p>By substituting 0.5 for the sample SD in the last inequality above,
we get</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\left( \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{0.02} \right)^2 &amp;\leq \text{Sample
Size} \\\
\left( \frac{0.5}{0.02} \right)^2 &amp;\leq \text{Sample Size} \\
25^2 &amp;\leq \text{Sample Size} \implies \text{Sample Size} \geq 625
\end{align*}
</span></p>
<p>We need to pick the smallest possible sample size that is greater
than or equal to 625; that’s just 625.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> SD, median, mean</p>
<p>The standard deviation will clearly be the smallest of the three
values as most of the data is encompassed between the range of
<code>[14-26]</code>. Intuitively, the standard deviation will have to
be about a third of this range which is around 4 (though this is not the
exact standard deviation, but is clearly much less than the mean and
median with values closer to 19-25). Comparing the median and mean, it
is important to visualize that this distribution is skewed right. When
the data is skewed right it pulls the mean towards a higher value (as
the higher values naturally make the average higher). Therefore, we know
that the mean will be greater than the median and the ranking is SD,
median, mean. </p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> the difference between the 75th percentile

<p>Since the distribution is right skewed, the 75th percentile will have
a larger difference from the 50th percentile than the 25th percentile.
With right skewness, values above the 50th percentile will be more
different than those smaller than the 50th percentile (and thus more

<p>The distribution which moves in 10 turns will have a smaller mean as
there are less turns to move spaces. Therefore, the mean movement from

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> True</p>
<p>Standard units standardize the data into z scores. When converting to
Z scores the scale of both the dependent and independent variables are
the same, and consequently, the slope can at most increase by 1.
Alternatively, according to the reference sheet, the slope of the
regression line, when both variables are measured in standard units, is
also equal to the correlation coefficient. And by definition, the
correlation coefficient can never be greater than 1 (since you can’t
have more than a ‘perfect’ correlation). </p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> False</p>
<p>A 95% confidence interval indicates we are 95% confident that the
true population parameter falls within the interval [L, R]. Note that
the problem specifies that the confidence interval is bootstrapped.
Since the interval is found using bootstrapping, L and R averaged will
not be the mean of the original sample since the mean of the original
sample is not what is used in calculating the bootstrapped confidence
interval. The bootstrapped confidence interval is created by re-sampling
the data with replacement over and over again. Thus, while the interval
is typically centered around the sample mean due to the nature of
bootstrapping, the average of L and R (the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles
of the distribution of bootstrapped means) may not exactly equal the
sample mean, but should be close to it. Additionally, L is the 2.5th
percentile of the distribution of bootstrapped means and R is the 97.5th
percentile, and these are not necessarily the same distance away from
the mean of the sample.</p>

<p>True, a 95% confidence interval indicates we are 95% confident that

at how a confidence interval is calculated is by adding/ subtracting a
confidence level value (z) by the standard error. Since the top and

<li><p>Correctly describe how to reject or fail to reject the null

<p>When conducting the hypothesis test, we first want to create a
confidence interval either by using bootstrapping or constructing a 95%
confidence interval to understand the true mean diameter of pizzas. The
next step is to define the rejection criteria, failing to reject the
null if 16 is within the 95% confidence interval (since we believe the
true population mean) is within this range with 95% confidence. We will
reject the null hypothesis if 16 is not within the 95% confidence
interval. Note that this assumes you used true mean diameter of pizzas
as your test statistic.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 79.20</p>
<p>To answer this question, first find the z score for a table of 5
people. Z = (5-3)/1 = 2. Now having this Z score, find the price that
correlated in the bill distribution by finding the value for 2 standard
deviations larger than the mean while also accounting for the
correlation between the two variables. This is calculated with mean +
((Z<em>SD) </em> r) which is 60 + ((12 * 2) * 0.8) = 79.20.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could solve for the regression line and plug our
values in according to the reference sheet:</p>
<p>m = (0.8) * (12/1) and b = 60 - (48/5) * 3 (where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept)</p>
<p>Thus plugging the appropriate values in our regression line
yields</p>

<p>From the definition provided in the question, we want all values of

find the percentiles for the range of 4 to 5 we can multiple (100/7) by
4 to get our lower bound. (100/7) * 4 = 57.14 which is rounded up to 58

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> permutation (A/B) testing</p>
<p>The question <em>Are nonfiction books longer than fiction books?</em>
is investigating the difference between two underlying populations
(nonfiction books and fiction books). A permutation test is the best
data science tool when investigating differences between two underlying
distributions.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> regression</p>
<p>The question at hand is investigating two continuous variables (time
and number of friends). Regression is the best data science tool as it
is dealing with two continuous variables and we can understand
correlations between time and the number of friends.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> hypothesis testing</p>
<p>The question at hand is dealing with differences between sales of
different flavors of ice cream, which is the same thing as the total of
ice cream cones sold. We can use hypothesis testing to test our null
hypothesis that the count of Vanilla cones sold is higher than
Chocolate, and our alternative hypothesis that the count of Chocolate
cones sold is more than Vanilla. A permutation test is not suitable here
because we are not comparing any numerical quantity associated with each
group. A permutation test could be used to answer questions like “Are
chocolate ice cream cones more expensive than vanilla ice cream cones?”
or “Do chocolate ice cream cones have more calories than vanilla ice
cream cones?”, or any other question where you are tracking a number
(cost or calories) along with each ice cream cone. In our case, however,
we are not tracking a number along with each individual ice cream cone,
but instead tracking a total of ice cream cones sold.</p>
<p>An analogy to this hypothesis test can be found in the “fair or
unfair coin” problem in Lectures 20 and 21, where our null hypothesis is
that the coin is fair and our alternative hypothesis is that the coin is
unfair. The “fairness” of the coin is not a numerical quantity that we
can track with each individual coin flip, just like how the count of ice
cream cones sold is not a numerical quantity that we can track with each
individual ice cream cone.</p>
