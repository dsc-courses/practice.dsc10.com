<p>Welcome to Sun God!</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/cartoon.png' width=20%></center>
<p>After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, UCSD‚Äôs annual music
festival, the Sun God festival, is back this year! Here, we‚Äôll be
looking at a DataFrame named <code>sungod</code> that contains
information on the artists who have performed at Sun God in years past.
<strong>For each year that the festival was held, we have one row for
each artist that performed that year.</strong> The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'Year'</code> (<code>int</code>): the year of the
festival</li>
<li><code>'Artist'</code> (<code>str</code>): the name of the
artist</li>
<li><code>'Appearance_Order'</code> (<code>int</code>): the order in
which the artist appeared in that year‚Äôs festival (1 means they came
onstage first)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rows of <code>sungod</code> are arranged in <strong>no particular
order</strong>. The first few rows of <code>sungod</code> are shown
below (though <code>sungod</code> has <strong>many more rows</strong>
than pictured here).</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/sungod.png' width=30%></center>
<p>Assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one artist ever appeared at a time (for example, we can‚Äôt have
two separate artists with a <code>'Year'</code> of 2015 and an
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code> of 3).</li>
<li>An artist may appear in multiple different Sun God festivals (they
could be invited back). <br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, the UCSD administration made some important changes to Sun
God policies, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eliminating guest tickets for non-students,</li>
<li>increasing security, and</li>
<li>introducing on-site medical care.</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes were implemented because of incidents related to drug
and alcohol abuse at the festival. At the 2013 Sun God festival, 48
students were hospitalized, and at the 2014 festival, only 8 students
were hospitalized. Assuming there was no change in the total number of
attendees from 2013 to 2014, which of the following statements is
correct?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> We cannot be sure if there is an association between administrative
changes and hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. One or more of the administrative changes is
responsible for the decrease in hospitalizations, but since several
administrative changes happened at the same time, we can‚Äôt be sure of
which one to credit with the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. We can‚Äôt be sure if any of the administrative changes
are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h2>
<p>Which of the following questions could not be answered by running a
randomized controlled experiment?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does eating citrus fruits increase the risk of heart disease?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Do exams with integrity pledges have fewer reported cases of academic
dishonesty?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does rewarding students for good grades improve high school
graduation rates?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life span?</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h2>
<p>In response to the pandemic, some airlines chose to leave middle
seats empty, while others continued seating passengers in middle seats.
Let‚Äôs suppose Delta did not seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic, and United did seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>Delta wants to know whether customers were satisfied with them for
making this decision not to use middle seats. Suppose they have access
to a dataset of customer satisfaction surveys, taken annually for each
airline. How can Delta determine whether its new seating policy caused
an increase in customer satisfaction?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta‚Äôs average customer satisfaction before and after this
change went into effect.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta‚Äôs average customer satisfaction after the change went
into effect to United‚Äôs average customer satisfaction at the same point
in time.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare the change in Delta‚Äôs average customer satisfaction to the
change in United‚Äôs average customer satisfaction, throughout the same
period of time, spanning the change.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>
