<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life
span?</p>
<p>It would be unethical to try to run a randomized controlled
experiment to address the question of whether drug abuse leads to a
shorter life span, as this would involve splitting participants into
groups and telling one group to abuse drugs. This is problematic because
we know drug abuse brings about a host of problems, so we could not
ethically ask people to harm themselves.</p>
<p>Notice that the first proposed study, about the impacts of citrus
fruits on heart disease, does not involve the same kind of ethical
dilemma because we’re not forcing people to do something known to be
harmful. A randomized controlled experiment would involve splitting
participants into two groups and asking one group to eat citrus fruits,
and measuring the heart health of both groups. Since there are no known
harmful effects of eating citrus fruits, there is no ethical issue.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could run a randomized controlled trial by giving an
exam where some students had to sign an integrity pledge and others
didn’t, tracking the number of reported dishonesty cases in each group.
Likewise, we could reward some students for good grades and not others,
and keep track of high school graduation rates in each group. Neither of
these studies would involve knowingly harming people and could
reasonably be carried out.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>In response to the pandemic, some airlines chose to leave middle
seats empty, while others continued seating passengers in middle seats.
Let’s suppose Delta did not seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic, and United did seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>Delta wants to know whether customers were satisfied with them for
making this decision not to use middle seats. Suppose they have access
to a dataset of customer satisfaction surveys, taken annually for each
airline. How can Delta determine whether its new seating policy caused
an increase in customer satisfaction?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction before and after this
change went into effect.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction after the change went
into effect to United’s average customer satisfaction at the same point
in time.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare the change in Delta’s average customer satisfaction to the
change in United’s average customer satisfaction, throughout the same
period of time, spanning the change.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>
</ul>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> None of the above.</p>
<p>None of the options isolate the effect of the seating policy because
they do not use randomized controlled trials. Even measuring the change
in each airline’s average satisfaction rating as described in the third
option is insufficient because we don’t know whether any differences are
due to the changed seating policy or other changes. It’s possible that
many things changed around the time of the pandemic, and we have no way
of separating the effects of each of these changes. For example, maybe
United stopped serving snacks during the pandemic and Delta continued
serving snacks, at around the same time as the seating changes went into
effect. If we find a difference in average customer satisfaction between
the airlines, we have no way of knowing whether it’s because of the
differences in seating policies or snack policies (or something
else).</p>

<p>Welcome to Sun God!</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/cartoon.png' width=20%></center>
<p>After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, UCSD’s annual music
festival, the Sun God festival, is back this year! In this exam, we’ll
be looking at a DataFrame named <code>sungod</code> that contains
information on the artists who have performed at Sun God in years past.
<strong>For each year that the festival was held, we have one row for
each artist that performed that year.</strong> The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'Year'</code> (<code>int</code>): the year of the
festival</li>
<li><code>'Artist'</code> (<code>str</code>): the name of the
artist</li>
<li><code>'Appearance_Order'</code> (<code>int</code>): the order in
which the artist appeared in that year’s festival (1 means they came
onstage first)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rows of <code>sungod</code> are arranged in <strong>no particular
order</strong>. The first few rows of <code>sungod</code> are shown
below (though <code>sungod</code> has <strong>many more rows</strong>
than pictured here).</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/sungod.png' width=30%></center>
<p>Assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one artist ever appeared at a time (for example, we can’t have
two separate artists with a <code>'Year'</code> of 2015 and an
<code>'Appearance_Order'</code> of 3).</li>
<li>An artist may appear in multiple different Sun God festivals (they
could be invited back). <br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, the UCSD administration made some important changes to Sun
God policies, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eliminating guest tickets for non-students,</li>
<li>increasing security, and</li>
<li>introducing on-site medical care.</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes were implemented because of incidents related to drug
and alcohol abuse at the festival. At the 2013 Sun God festival, 48
students were hospitalized, and at the 2014 festival, only 8 students
were hospitalized. Assuming there was no change in the total number of
attendees from 2013 to 2014, which of the following statements is
correct?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> We cannot be sure if there is an association between administrative
changes and hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. One or more of the administrative changes is
responsible for the decrease in hospitalizations, but since several
administrative changes happened at the same time, we can’t be sure of
which one to credit with the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of the administrative changes
are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> There is an association between
administrative changes and hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of
the administrative changes are responsible for the reduction in
hospitalizations.</p>
<p>We know there is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations because the number of hospitalized students dropped
after the changes went into effect.</p>
<p>However, since no randomized controlled trial was done, we can’t be
sure of the reason for the reduction in hospitalizations. For example,
maybe there were fewer hospitalizations because a new flavor of
sparkling water came out in 2014, and people drank that instead of
alcohol. We just don’t know enough to conclude any causal explanation
for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h2>
<p>Write one line of code below to create a DataFrame called
<code>openers</code> containing the artists that appeared first on stage
at a past Sun God festival. The DataFrame <code>openers</code> should
have all the same columns as <code>sungod</code>.</p>
<p>It’s okay if you need to write on two lines to fit into the provided
space, as long as your answer would be one line of Python code.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>
<code>openers = sungod[sungod.get('Appearance_Order')==1]</code></p>
<p>Since we want only certain rows of <code>sungod</code>, we need to
query. The condition to satisfy is that the ‘Appearance_Order’ column
should have a value of 1 to indicate that this artist performed first in
a certain year’s festival.</p>
