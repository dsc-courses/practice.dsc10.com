<p>The problems in this worksheet are taken from past exams. Work on them <strong>on paper</strong>, since the exams you take in this course will also be on paper. <br><br>We encourage you to complete this worksheet in a discussion section, which are held live on Monday, September 26th. Solutions will be made available after all discussion sections have concluded. You don‚Äôt need to submit your answers anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<p>Which of the following questions could not be answered by running a randomized controlled experiment?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does eating citrus fruits increase the risk of heart disease?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Do exams with integrity pledges have fewer reported cases of academic dishonesty?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does rewarding students for good grades improve high school graduation rates?</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life span?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>
<p>The following is a quote from The New York Times‚Äô <em>The Morning</em> newsletter.</p>
<p><i>As Dr.¬†Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me this weekend: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually care about infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term complications.‚Äù </i></p>
<p><i>By those measures, all five of the vaccines ‚Äî from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson ‚Äî look extremely good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.</i></p>
<p><i>To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has done so far to <strong>a representative group of 75,000 American adults</strong>: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero and nearly zero, based on the research trials.</i></p>
<p><i>Zero isn‚Äôt even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and hospitalizes more than 100 of them.</i></p>
<p>Why does the article use a representative group of 75,000 American adults?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Convention. Rates are often given per 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comprehension. Readers should have a sense of the scale of 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Arbitrary. There is no particular reason to use a group of this size.</p></li>
</ul>
