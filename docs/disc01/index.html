<p>The problems in this worksheet are taken from past exams. Work on
them <strong>on paper</strong>, since the exams you take in this course
will also be on paper. <br><br>We encourage you to complete this
worksheet in a discussion section, which are held live on Monday,
September 26th. Solutions will be made available after all discussion
sections have concluded. You don’t need to submit your answers
anywhere.</p>

<p>Which of the following questions could not be answered by running a

<p>The following is a quote from The New York Times’ <em>The
Morning</em> newsletter.</p>
<p><i>As Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of
Public Health, told me this weekend: “I don’t actually care about
infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term
complications.” </i></p>
<p><i>By those measures, all five of the vaccines — from Pfizer,
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely
good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in
a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a
few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained
hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.</i></p>
<p><i>To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has
done so far to <strong>a representative group of 75,000 American
adults</strong>: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several
hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero
and nearly zero, based on the research trials.</i></p>
<p><i>Zero isn’t even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu
season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and
hospitalizes more than 100 of them.</i></p>
<p>Why does the article use a representative group of 75,000 American
adults?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Convention. Rates are often given per 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of
people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comprehension. Readers should have a sense of the scale of 75,000
people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Arbitrary. There is no particular reason to use a group of this
size.</p></li>

<p>In response to the pandemic, some airlines chose to leave middle
seats empty, while others continued seating passengers in middle seats.
Let’s suppose Delta did not seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic, and United did seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>Delta wants to know whether customers were satisfied with them for
making this decision not to use middle seats. Suppose they have access
to a dataset of customer satisfaction surveys, taken annually for each
airline. How can Delta determine whether its new seating policy caused
an increase in customer satisfaction?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction before and after this
change went into effect.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction after the change went
into effect to United’s average customer satisfaction at the same point
in time.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare the change in Delta’s average customer satisfaction to the
change in United’s average customer satisfaction, throughout the same
period of time, spanning the change.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which of the following claims can be tested using a randomized
controlled trial? Select all that apply.</p>

<p>Every spring quarter since 1990, UCSD has held the Sun God Festival.
This daytime festival is considered to be one of the best college music
festivals since it has featured major artists like Kendrick Lamar,
Drake, Macklemore, Snoop Dogg, and the Black Eyed Peas.</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/cartoon.png' width=20%></center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>In 2014, the UCSD administration made some important changes to Sun
God policies, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eliminating guest tickets for non-students,</li>
<li>increasing security, and</li>
<li>introducing on-site medical care.</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes were implemented because of incidents related to drug
and alcohol abuse at the festival. At the 2013 Sun God festival, 48
students were hospitalized, and at the 2014 festival, only 8 students
were hospitalized. Assuming there was no change in the total number of
attendees from 2013 to 2014, which of the following statements is
correct?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> We cannot be sure if there is an association between administrative
changes and hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. One or more of the administrative changes is
responsible for the decrease in hospitalizations, but since several
administrative changes happened at the same time, we can’t be sure of
which one to credit with the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of the administrative changes
are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> None of the above.</p></li>
