<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life
span?</p>
<p>It would be unethical to try to run a randomized controlled
experiment to address the question of whether drug abuse leads to a
shorter life span, as this would involve splitting participants into
groups and telling one group to abuse drugs. This is problematic because
we know drug abuse brings about a host of problems, so we could not
ethically ask people to harm themselves.</p>
<p>Notice that the first proposed study, about the impacts of citrus
fruits on heart disease, does not involve the same kind of ethical
dilemma because we’re not forcing people to do something known to be
harmful. A randomized controlled experiment would involve splitting
participants into two groups and asking one group to eat citrus fruits,
and measuring the heart health of both groups. Since there are no known
harmful effects of eating citrus fruits, there is no ethical issue.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could run a randomized controlled trial by giving an
exam where some students had to sign an integrity pledge and others
didn’t, tracking the number of reported dishonesty cases in each group.
Likewise, we could reward some students for good grades and not others,
and keep track of high school graduation rates in each group. Neither of
these studies would involve knowingly harming people and could
reasonably be carried out.</p>

<p>The following is a quote from The New York Times’ <em>The
Morning</em> newsletter.</p>
<p><i>As Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of
Public Health, told me this weekend: “I don’t actually care about
infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term
complications.” </i></p>
<p><i>By those measures, all five of the vaccines — from Pfizer,
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely
good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in
a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a
few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained
hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.</i></p>
<p><i>To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has
done so far to <strong>a representative group of 75,000 American
adults</strong>: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several
hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero
and nearly zero, based on the research trials.</i></p>
<p><i>Zero isn’t even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu
season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and
hospitalizes more than 100 of them.</i></p>
<p>Why does the article use a representative group of 75,000 American
adults?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Convention. Rates are often given per 75,000 people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of
people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Comprehension. Readers should have a sense of the scale of 75,000
people.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Arbitrary. There is no particular reason to use a group of this
size.</p></li>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Comparison. It allows for quick comparison
against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the article is to compare Covid outcomes among two
groups of people: the 75,000 people who got the vaccine in a research
trial and a representative group of 75,000 American adults. Since 75,000
people got the vaccine in a research trial, we need to compare
statistics like number of deaths and hospitalizations to another group
of the same size for the comparison to be meaningful.</p>
<p>There is no convention about using 75,000 for rates. This number is
used because that’s how many people got the vaccine in a research trial.
If a different number of people had been vaccinated in a research trial,
the article would have taken that number of adults in their
representative comparison group.</p>
<p>75,000 is quite a large number and most people probably don’t have a
sense of the scale of 75,000 people. If the goal were comprehension, it
would have made more sense to use a smaller number like 100 people.</p>
<p>The number 75,000 is not arbitrary. It was chosen as the size of the
representative group specifically to equal the number of people who got
the vaccine in a research trial.</p>

<p>In response to the pandemic, some airlines chose to leave middle
seats empty, while others continued seating passengers in middle seats.
Let’s suppose Delta did not seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic, and United did seat passengers in middle seats during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>Delta wants to know whether customers were satisfied with them for
making this decision not to use middle seats. Suppose they have access
to a dataset of customer satisfaction surveys, taken annually for each
airline. How can Delta determine whether its new seating policy caused
an increase in customer satisfaction?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction before and after this
change went into effect.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare Delta’s average customer satisfaction after the change went
into effect to United’s average customer satisfaction at the same point
in time.</p></li>
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> Compare the change in Delta’s average customer satisfaction to the
change in United’s average customer satisfaction, throughout the same
period of time, spanning the change.</p></li>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> None of the above.</p>
<p>None of the options isolate the effect of the seating policy because
they do not use randomized controlled trials. Even measuring the change
in each airline’s average satisfaction rating as described in the third
option is insufficient because we don’t know whether any differences are
due to the changed seating policy or other changes. It’s possible that
many things changed around the time of the pandemic, and we have no way
of separating the effects of each of these changes. For example, maybe
United stopped serving snacks during the pandemic and Delta continued
serving snacks, at around the same time as the seating changes went into
effect. If we find a difference in average customer satisfaction between
the airlines, we have no way of knowing whether it’s because of the
differences in seating policies or snack policies (or something
else).</p>

<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drinking Gatorade causes a player to gain Instagram followers.</li>
<li>Deleting Twitter causes a player to gain Instagram followers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to this problem is understanding the nature of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). To run an RCT, we must be able to randomly
assign our test subjects to either a treatment or control group, and
apply some treatment only to the treatment group. With that in mind,
let’s look at the four options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Here, the treatment would be winning two
games in a row. However, this is not something we could apply to a
treatment group, since we can’t control whether or not basketball
players win games (let alone two games in a row). As such, this is not
an RCT we could run.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Here, the treatment would be drinking
Gatorade. We indeed could have a treatment group drink Gatorade; this is
no different than having a treatment group take some form of medicine.
This is an RCT we could run.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Here, the treatment would be playing for
the Las Vegas Aces. Similar to Option 1, this is not an RCT we could
run, since we can’t control which teams players play for.</li>
<li><strong>Option 4:</strong> Here, the treatment would be deleting
Twitter. While they may not like it, we could have players participating
in our study delete their Twitter accounts, so this is an RCT we could
run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, our assessment above did not look at the outcome, gaining
Instagram followers, at all. While to us it may seem unlikely that
drinking Gatorade causes a player to gain Instagram followers, that
doesn’t mean we can’t run an RCT to check.</p>

<h2 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h2>
<p>Every spring quarter since 1990, UCSD has held the Sun God Festival.
This daytime festival is considered to be one of the best college music
festivals since it has featured major artists like Kendrick Lamar,
Drake, Macklemore, Snoop Dogg, and the Black Eyed Peas.</p>
<center><img src='../assets/images/sp22-midterm/cartoon.png' width=20%></center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>In 2014, the UCSD administration made some important changes to Sun
God policies, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eliminating guest tickets for non-students,</li>
<li>increasing security, and</li>
<li>introducing on-site medical care.</li>
</ol>
<p>These changes were implemented because of incidents related to drug
and alcohol abuse at the festival. At the 2013 Sun God festival, 48
students were hospitalized, and at the 2014 festival, only 8 students
were hospitalized. Assuming there was no change in the total number of
attendees from 2013 to 2014, which of the following statements is
correct?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> We cannot be sure if there is an association between administrative

<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and

<li><p><input type="radio" disabled="" /> There is an association between administrative changes and

are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p></li>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> There is an association between
administrative changes and hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of
the administrative changes are responsible for the reduction in
hospitalizations.</p>
<p>We know there is an association between administrative changes and
hospitalizations because the number of hospitalized students dropped
after the changes went into effect.</p>
<p>However, since no randomized controlled trial was done, we can’t be
sure of the reason for the reduction in hospitalizations. For example,
maybe there were fewer hospitalizations because a new flavor of
sparkling water came out in 2014, and people drank that instead of
alcohol. We just don’t know enough to conclude any causal explanation
for the reduction in hospitalizations.</p>
