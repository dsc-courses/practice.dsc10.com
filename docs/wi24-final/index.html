<p>The Olympic Games are the world’s leading international sporting
event, dating back to ancient Greece. Today, we’ll explore data on
modern Olympic medalists. Each row in the DataFrame
<code>olympians</code> corresponds to a type of medal earned by one
Olympic athlete in one year.</p>
<p>The columns of <code>olympians</code> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"Name"</code> (<code>str</code>): The name of the athlete.
Unique for each athlete.</li>
<li><code>"Sex"</code> (<code>str</code>): The sex of the athlete,
denoted by “M” or “F”.</li>
<li><code>"Age"</code> (<code>int</code>): The age of the athlete at the
time of the Olympics.</li>
<li><code>"Height"</code> (<code>float</code>): The height of the
athlete in centimeters.</li>
<li><code>"Weight"</code> (<code>float</code>): The weight of the
athlete in kilograms.</li>
<li><code>"Sport"</code> (<code>str</code>): The sport in which the
athlete competed.</li>
<li><code>"Team"</code> (<code>str</code>): The team or country the
athlete represented.</li>
<li><code>"Medal"</code> (<code>str</code>): The type of medal won
(“Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze”).</li>
<li><code>"Year"</code> (<code>int</code>): The year of the Olympic
Games.</li>
<li><code>"Count"</code> (<code>int</code>): The number of medals of
this type earned by this athlete in this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first few rows of <code>olympians</code> are shown below, though
<code>olympians</code> has many more rows than pictured. The data in
<code>olympians</code> is only a sample from the much larger population
of all Olympic medalists.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: None of these.</p>
<p>To decide what an appropriate index would be, we need to keep in mind
that in each row, the index should have a unique value – that is, we
want the index to uniquely identify rows of the DataFrame. In this case,
there will obviously be repeats in <code>"team"</code> and
<code>"sport"</code>, since these will appear multiple times for each
Olympic event. Although the name is unique for each athlete, the same
athlete could compete in multiple Olympics (for example, Michael Phelps
competed in both 2008 and 2004). So, none of these options is a valid
index.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>["Name", "Sport"]</code> or
<code>["Sport", "Name"]</code></p>
<p>The question wants us to find the name (Frank X. Kugler) who has
records that correspond to three distinct sports. We know that the same
athlete might have multiple records for a distinct sport if they
participated in the same sport for multiple years. Therefore we should
groupby <code>"Name"</code> and <code>"Sport"</code> to create a
DataFrame with unique Name-Sport pairs. This is a DataFrame that
contains the athletes and their sports (for each athlete, their
corresponding sports are distinct). If an athlete participated in 2
sports, for example, they would have 2 rows corresponding to them in the
DataFrame, 1 row for each distinct sport.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>.sum()</code> or <code>.mean()</code>
or <code>.min()</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Any aggregation method applied on <code>df.groupby()</code> would
work. We only want to remove cases in which an athlete participates in
the same sport for multiple years, and get unique name-sport pairs.
Therefore, we don’t care about the aggregated numeric value. Notice
<code>.unique()</code> is not correct because it is not an aggregation
method used on dataframe after grouping by. If you use
<code>.unique()</code>, it will give you “AttributeError:
‘DataFrameGroupBy’ object has no attribute ‘unique’”. However,
<code>.unique()</code> can be used after <code>Series.groupby()</code>.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>"Name"</code></p>
<p>Now after resetting the index, we have <code>"Name"</code> and
<code>"Sport"</code> columns containing unique name-sport pairs. The
objective is to count how many different sports each Olympian has medals
in. To do that, we groupby <code>"Name"</code> and later use the
<code>.count()</code> method. This would give a new DataFrame that has a
count of how many times each name shows up in our previous DataFrame

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>.count()</code></p>
<p>The <code>.count()</code> method is applied to each group. In this
context, <code>.count()</code> will get the number of entries for each
Olympian across different sports, since the previous steps ensured each
sport per Olympian is uniquely listed (due to the initial groupby on
both <code>"Name"</code> and <code>"Sport"</code>). It does not matter
what we sort_values by, because the
<code>.groupby('Name').count()</code> method will just put a count of
each <code>"Name"</code> in all of the columns, regardless of the column
name or what value was originally in it.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Options 1, 2, and 5 are correct.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The mean of the new distribution where weight is in pounds would be
given by <span class="math inline">2.2 \cdot \text{mean}</span> in
kilograms. Since the mean in kilograms is positive, this quantity must
then increase if we multiply it by 2.2. Intuitively this should make
sense as we are basically scaling all the (positive) values by 2.2 (a
positive constant), so we expect the values to increase and thus the
mean to increase. So, option 1 is correct.</li>
<li>The standard deviation of the new distribution where weight is in
pounds would be given by <span class="math inline">2.2  \cdot
\text{standard deviation}</span> in kilograms. Since the standard
deviation in kilograms is positive, this quantity must then increase if
we multiply it by 2.2. Intuitively this should make sense as we are
scaling all the values by 2.2, so the difference between larger and
smaller values will be greater once they are scaled. Thus, we expect the
spread of our distribution to be larger, and the standard deviation to
increase. So, option 2 is correct.</li>
<li>We are basically interested in the proportion of <span class="math inline">x_{i}</span> that satisfy <span class="math inline">\vert \frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ} \vert&lt;3</span>,
with <span class="math inline">x_{i}</span> being the values of
<code>"Weight"</code>, μ being the mean in kg and σ being the standard
deviation in kg. Once we scale everything by 2.2 to convert from
kilograms to pounds, we have that<br/>
<span class="math inline">\vert
\frac{2.2x_{i}-2.2μ}{2.2σ}\vert&lt;3</span> → <span class="math inline">\frac{2.2}{2.2}\vert
\frac{x~i~*μ}{σ}\vert&lt;3</span> → <span class="math inline">\vert
\frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ}\vert&lt;3</span>.<br/>
Notice that after we scaled it to pounds, the equation still ends up the
exact same as the one in kg. Thus, the proportion of
<code>"Weight"</code> within 3 standard deviations of the mean stays the
same. Intuitively this should make sense because we are scaling
everything by the same amount, so the proportion of points that are a
specific number of standard deviations away from the mean should be the
same, since the standard deviation and mean get scaled as well. So,
option 3 is incorrect.</li>
<li>Recall that the correlation coefficient, r, is the average value of
the product of two variables, when both variables are measured in
standard units. In kilograms, <code>"Weight"</code>(kg) in standard
units is <span class="math inline">\frac{x~i~−μ}{σ}</span>. Similar to
option 3, <code>"Weight"</code>(pounds) in standard units is <span class="math inline">\frac{2.2x_{i}-2.2μ}{2.2σ} = \frac{2.2}{2.2}
\frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ} = \frac{x_{i} \cdot μ}{σ}</span>. Again, notice
that the equation in pounds ends up the exact same as in kilograms. The
same applies for <code>"Height"</code> in standard units. Since none of
the variables change when measured in standard units, r doesn’t change.
So, option 4 is incorrect.</li>
<li>Intuitively, this makes sense when we imagine a scatterplot with the
y-axis (value being predicted) representing <code>"Weight"</code> and
the x-axis representing <code>"Height"</code>. We expect that the taller
someone is, the heavier they will be. So we can expect a positive
regression line slope between Weight and Height. When we convert Weight
from kg to pounds, we are scaling every value in <code>"Weight"</code>,
making their values increase. When we scale the the weight values
(y-values) to become bigger, we are making the regression slope even
steeper, because an increase in Height (x) now corresponds to an even
larger increase in Weight(y). So, option 5 is correct.</li>
<li>Similar to the last problem, we can also imagine a scatterplot
except this time with <code>"Weight"</code> on the x-axis and
<code>"Height"</code> on the y-axis. Since we are increasing the values
of <code>"Height"</code>, we can imagine stretching the x-axis’ values
without changing the y-values, which makes the line more flat and
therefore decreases the slope. So, option 6 is incorrect. Another
approach to both 5 and 6 is to utilize the correlation coefficient
<em>r</em>, which is equal to the slope times <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span>. We know that multiplying a
set values by a value greater than one increases the spread of the data
which increases standard deviation. In option 5, <code>"Weight"</code>
is in the y-axis, and increasing the numerator of the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span> increases <em>r</em>. In
option 6, <code>"Weight"</code> is in the x-axis, and increasing the
denominator the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{σ~y~}{σ~x~}</span> decreases <em>r</em>.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 1 and Way 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Way 1: This function first checks if the year is divisible by 4, and
returns “Summer” if it is. If the year isn’t divisible by 4, then the
code inside that if statement won’t execute, and we move on to the next
line of code, which just returns “Winter”, as we wanted. So, way 1 is
correct.</li>
<li>Way 2 looks similar to way 1, but has one key difference: the
<code>return "Winter"</code> line is <strong>before</strong> the if
statement. Since nothing after a return statement gets executed
(assuming that the return statement gets executed), no matter what the
year is this function will always return “Winter”. So, way 2 is
incorrect.</li>
<li>Way 3 doesn’t account for the fact that all years which are
multiples of 4 are also multiples of 2. So even though it gets the 2022
Winter Olympics correct, it will also return “Winter” for 2020 since
<code>2020 % 2</code> evaluates to <code>0</code>. So, way 3 is
incorrect.</li>
<li>Way 4 uses similar logic to way 1, just using a different method to
check for divisibility. Instead of using the modulo operator, we check
if casting <code>year / 4</code> to an integer using <code>int</code>
changes its value. If the two aren’t equal, then we know that
<code>year / 4</code> wasn’t an integer before casting, which means that
the year isn’t divisible by 4 and we should return
<code>"Winter"</code>. If the code inside the if statement doesn’t
execute, then we know that the year is divisible by 4, so we return
“Summer”. So, way 4 is correct.</li>

<h2 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h2>
<p>In figure skating, skaters move around an ice rink performing a
series of skills, such as jumps and spins. Ylesia has been training for
the Olympics, and she has a set routine that she plans to perform.</p>
<p>Let’s say that Ylesia performs a skill successfully if she does not
fall during that skill. Each skill comes with its own probability of
success, as some skills are harder and some are easier. Suppose that the
probabilities of success for each skill in Ylesia’s Olympic routine are
stored in an array called <code>skill_success</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if Ylesia’s Olympic routine happened to only contain
three skills, <code>skill_success</code> might be the array with values
0.92, 0.84, 0.92. However, her routine can contain any number of
skills.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-5.1">Problem 5.1</h3>
<p>Ylesia wants to simulate one Olympic routine to see how many times
she might fall. Fill in the function <code>count_falls</code> below,

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> (a): <code>[p, 1-p]</code>, (b):
<code>falls + result[1]</code> OR (a): <code>[1-p, p]</code>, (b):
<code>falls + result[0]</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>(a)</strong> First, we should think about what
np.random.multinomial is trying to do here. It’s trying to make an array
of how many times each scenario happened. There are 2 possible scenarios
here: Ylesia succeeds or Ylesia fails. In this code, p is the
probability that Ylesia succeeds a skill, and therefore the probabilty
that Ylesia does not succeed (she fails) will be 1-p. So to properly
simulate how many times she falls, we should put <code>[p, 1-p]</code>
in blank (a).</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> Our answer from (a) will make an array stored
in <code>result</code>, with index 0 being how many times she succeeded
(corresponds to p), and index 1 being how many times she fell
(corresponds to 1-p). Since index 1 corresponds to the scenario in which
she falls, in order to correctly increase the number of falls, we add
<code>falls</code> by <code>result[1]</code>. Therefore, blank (b) is
<code>falls + result[1]</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Likewise, you can change the order with (a): <code>[1-p, p]</code>
and (b): <code>falls + result[0]</code> and it would still correctly
simulate how many times she falls.</p>

<li><strong>(a)</strong> We start with the initial value of

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>(a): <code>count_falls(skill_success)</code>,

are many other correct solutions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>(a)</strong> For this question, we are doing a simulation
where we calculate the probability of Ylesia not falling during her
routine based on 10,000 trials. To do so, we want to find out the number
of times that Yelsia did not fall any skill during her routine out of
the 10,000 trials. Based on the given codes, we have an array where we
are appending something into that array for each trial. We can utilize
the function defined in part a to calculate the number of times Ylesia
falls during a single trial so blank a will be
<code>count_falls(skill_success)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> After 10,000 iterations, we have an array of
the number of falls for each trial. Then, we want to count the number of
times that we get 0 in that array, which means Ylesia did not fall.
Lastly, to get the probability, we will need to divide by the total
number of trials which is 10,000. This gives us the answer for blank b:
<code>np.count_nonzero(results == 0) / 10000</code>.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The sample is much smaller than the
population.</p>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that regardless of the shape
of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample
mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is
sufficiently large. The key factor that makes it reasonable to still use
the CLT, is the sample size relative to the population size. When the
sample size is much smaller than the population size, as in this case
where 400 rows of Olympians are sampled from a likely much larger
population of Olympians, the effect of sampling without replacement
becomes negligible.</p>

<p>We calculate the mean by first determining the width of our interval:
26.1 - 24.9 = 1.2, then we divide this width in half to get 0.6 which

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> difference in the number of medals won by
American gymnasts and the number of medals won by Romanian gymnasts</p>
<p>To test this pair of hypotheses, we need a test statistic that is
large when the data suggests that we reject the null hypothesis, and
small when we fail to reject the null. Now let’s look at each
option:<br/>
- <strong>Option 1:</strong> Total variation distance across all the
countries won’t tell us about the differences in medals between
Americans and Romanians. In this case, it only tells how different the
proportions are across all countries in comparison to the uniform
distribution, the mean proportion. - <strong>Option 2:</strong> This
test statistic doesn’t take into account the number of medals Romanians
won. Imagine a situation where Romanians won half of all the medals and
Americans won the other half, and no other country won any medals. In
here, they won the same amount of medals and the test statistic would be
1/2. Now imagine if Americans win half the medals, some other country
won the other half, and Romanians won no medals. In this case, the
Americans won a lot more medals than Romanians but the test statistic is
still 1/2. A good test statistic should point to one hypothesis when
it’s large and the other hypothesis when it’s small. In this test
statistic, 1/2 points to both hypotheses, making it a bad test
statistic.<br/>
- <strong>Option 3:</strong> In this test statistic, when Americans win
an equal amount of medals as Romanians, the test statistic would be 0, a
very small number. When Americans win way more medals than Romanians,
the test statistic is large, suggesting that we reject the null
hypothesis in favor of the alternative. You might notice that when
Romanians win way more medals than Americans, the test statistic would
be negative, suggesting that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that
they won equal medals. But recall that failing to reject the null
doesn’t necessarily mean we think the null is true, it just means that
under our null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, the null is
plausible. The important thing is that the test statistic points to the
alternative hypothesis when it’s large, and points to the null
hypothesis when it’s small. This test statistic does just that, so
option 3 is the correct answer.<br/>
- <strong>Option 4:</strong> Since this statistic is an absolute value,
large values signify a large difference in the two proportions, while
small values signify a small difference in two proportions. However, it
doesn’t tell which country wins more because a large value could mean
that either country has a higher proportion of medals than the other.
This hypothesis would only be helpful if our alternative hypothesis was
that the number of medals the Americans/ Romanians win are
different.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 1: <code>126/245 - 119/245</code> or
<code>7/245</code></p>
<p>First, let’s look at what this code is doing. The line
<code>result = np.random.multinomial(245, [0.5, 0.5]) / 245</code> makes
an array of length 2, where each of the 2 elements contains the amount
of the 245 total medals corresponding to the amount of medals won by
American gymnasts and Romanian gymnasts respectively. We then divide
this array by 245 to turn them into proportions out of 245 (which is the
sum of 126+119). This array of proportions is then assigned to
<code>result</code>. For example, one of our 10000 repetitions could
assign <code>np.array([124/245, 121/245])</code> to <code>result</code>.
The following line,
<code>many_stats = np.append(many_stats, result[0] - result[1])</code>,
appends the difference between the first proportion in
<code>result</code> and the second proportion in <code>result</code> to
<code>many_stats</code>. Using our example, this would append 124/245 -
121/245 (which equals 3/245) to <code>many_stats</code>. To determine
how we calculate the observed statistic, we have to consider how we are
calculating the p-value. In order to calculate the p-value, we need to
determine how frequent it is to see a result as extreme as our observed
statistic, or more extreme in the direction of the alternative
hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis states that American gymnasts win
more medals than Romanian gymnasts, meaning that we are looking for
results in <code>many_stats</code> where the difference is equal to or
greater than (more extreme than) 126/245 - 119/245 (which equals 7/245).
That is, the final line of code in Way 1 is using
<code>np.count_nonzero</code> to find the amount of differences in
<code>many_stats</code> greater than 7/245. Therefore, observed must
equal 7/245.</p>

</p>
<p>The average score on this problem was 56%.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 2: <code>119/245 - 126/245</code> or
<code>-7/245</code></p>
<p>The only difference between Way 2 and Way 1 is that in Way 2, the
<code>&gt;=</code> is switched to a <code>&lt;=</code>. This causes a
result as extreme or more extreme than our observed statistic to now be
represented as anything less than or equal to our observed statistic. To
account for this, we need to consider the first proportion in
<code>result</code> as the number of medals won by Romanian gymnasts,
and the second proportion as the number of medals won by American
gymnasts. This flips the sign of all of the proportions. So instead of
calculating our observed statistic as <span class="math inline">\frac{126}{245}-\frac{119}{245}</span>, we now
calculate it as <span class="math inline">\frac{119}{245}-\frac{126}{245}</span> (which equals
<span class="math inline">\frac{-7}{245}</span>).</p>

<h5>Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️⭐️</h5>
<p>
</p>
<p>The average score on this problem was 53%.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 3: <code>126/245</code></p>
<p>The difference between way 1 and way 3 is that way 3 is now taking
<code>results[0]</code> as its test statistic instead of
<code>results[0] - results[1]</code>, which represents the number of
Olympic gymnastics medals won by American gymnasts. This means that the
observed statistic should be the number of medals won by America in the
given sample. In that case, the observed statistics will be <span class="math inline">\frac{\text{# of American medals}}{\text{# of
American medals} + \text{# of Romanian medals}}</span> = <span class="math inline">\frac{126}{245}</span></p>

<h5>Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️⭐️</h5>
<p>
</p>
<p>The average score on this problem was 52%.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 4: <code>119/245</code></p>
<p>Since now the sign is swapped from <code>&gt;=</code> in way 3 to
<code>&lt;=</code> in way 4, <code>results[0]</code> represent the
number of Romanian medals won. This is because the alternative
hypothesis states that America wins more medals than Romania,
demonstrating that the observed statistics is <code>119/245</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the standard unit regression line again, <span class="math inline">y_{su}=r \cdot x_{su}</span>. Since we are

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 74</p>
<p>Let’s consider 4 separate cases, the athletes who make it into the
final round, the athletes who are eliminated in the 3rd round, the
athletes who are eliminated in the 2nd round, and the athletes who are
eliminated in the 1st round. There are two athletes in the final round,
and both of their names appear four times. When merging
<code>breaking</code> with itself, these two athletes will appear 16
times each in the merged dataframe (<span class="math inline">4 \cdot
4</span>). Two athletes are eliminated in the 3rd round, and their names
each appear 3 times in <code>breaking</code>. When merging
<code>breaking</code> with itself, these two athletes will appear 9
times each in the merged dataframe (<span class="math inline">3 \cdot
3</span>). Four athletes are eliminated in the 2nd round, and their
names each appear twice in <code>breaking</code>. When merging
<code>breaking</code> with itself, these four athletes will appear 4
times each in the merged dataframe (<span class="math inline">2 \cdot
2</span>). Eight athletes are eliminated in the 1st round, and their
names each appear once in <code>breaking</code>. When merging
<code>breaking</code> with itself, these eight athletes will appear 1
time each in the merged dataframe (<span class="math inline">1 \cdot
1</span>). Now, we can add these numbers all up, <span class="math inline">16 \cdot 2 + 9 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 4 + 8 \cdot 1 =

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Way 1 and Way 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Way 1 first creates a DataFrame <code>bv</code>, which is a subset
DataFrame of <code>olympians</code> but filtered to only have
<code>"Beach Volleyball"</code>. It then samples from <code>bv</code>
with replacement, and counts the mean of that sample and stores it in
the variable <code>one_sample</code>. It does this 10,000 times (due to
the for loop), each time creating a dataframe <code>bv</code>, sampling
from it, calculating a mean, and then appending <code>one_sample</code>
to the array <code>sample_means</code>. This is a correct way to
bootstrap.</li>
<li>Way 2 is incorrect because it calculates one_mean using a sample
from the entire <code>olympians</code> DataFrame, instead of the bv
DataFrame with only the <code>"Beach Volleyball"</code> players. This
will result in a sample of players of any sport, and the mean of those
ages will be calculated.</li>
<li>Way 3 is incorrect because it queries for rows where the data in the
<code>"Sport"</code> column equals <code>"Beach Volleyball"</code> after
sampling from the DataFrame instead of before. This would lead to a mean
that is not representative of a sample of volleyball players’ ages
because we are sampling from all the rows with all different sports,
most likely resulting in a smaller sample size of volleyball players.
There would also be an inconsistent number of
<code>"Beach Volleyball"</code> players in each sample.</li>
<li>Way 4 is essentially the same as Way 1, except it creates the
DataFrame <code>bv</code> before the for loop. The DataFrame
<code>bv</code> will always be the same, so it doesn’t really matter if
we make <code>bv</code> before or after the for loop.</li>
<li>Way 5 is incorrect because the <code>one_mean</code> is calculated
only once, but is appended to the <code>sample_means</code> array 10,000
times. As a result, the same mean is being appended, instead of a
different mean being calculated and appended each iteration.</li>

<p>Here, we are plotting the data of 2 athletes, comparing the medal
distributions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are categorical
variables, while the proportion of these won is a quantitative value. A
bar chart is the only kind of plot that involves categorical data with
quantitative data. Since there are 2 athletes, the most appropriate plot
is an overlaid bar chart. The overlapping bars would help compare the

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Franziska van Almsick</p>
<p>The Total Variation Distance (TVD) of two categorical distributions
is the sum of the absolute differences of their proportions, all divided
by 2. We can apply the TVD formula to these distributions: The TVD
between Katie Ledecky and Aladar Gerevich is given by <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot (|0.7 - 0.7| + |0.1 - 0.3| + |0.2
- 0|) = \frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2</span>. The TVD between Alexander Dityatin
and Aladar Gerevich is given by <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}
\cdot (|0.7 - 0.3| + |0.1 - 0.6| + |0.2 - 0.1|) = \frac{1}{2} =

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> x=0, y=1, z=0</p>
<p>Intuitively, can maximize the TVD between the distributions by
putting all of Pallavi’s medals in the category which Gerevich won the
least of, so x = 0, y = 1, z = 0. Moving any of these medals to another
category would decrease the TVD, since that would mean that all of
Pallavi’s medal proportions would get closer to Gerevich’s (Silver is
decreasing, getting closer, and Gold and Bronze are increasing, which
makes them closer as well).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>1 - medal_dist.min()</code></p>
<p>Similar to part c, we know that the TVD is maximized by placing all
the medals of competitor A into the category in which competitor B has
the lowest proportion of medals. If we place all of competitor A’s
medals into this bin, the difference between the two distributions for
this variable will be <code>1 - medal_dist.min()</code> In the other
bins, competitor A has no medals (making all their values 0), and
competitor B has the remainder of their medals, which is
<code>1 - medal_dist.min()</code>. So, in total, the TVD is given by
<span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot</span>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Since the test aims to determine whether a
parameter is equal to a fixed value</p>
<p>The goal of a confidence interval is to provide a range of values
that, given the data, are considered plausible for the parameter in
question. If the null hypothesis’ fixed value does not fall within this
interval, it suggests that the observed data is not very compatible with
the null hypothesis. Thus in our case, if a 95% confidence interval for
the proportion of medals won by China does not include ~0.5, then
there’s statistical evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest
that China does not win exactly half of the medals. So again in our
case, confidence intervals work to test this hypothesis because we are
attempting to find out whether or half of the medals (0.5) lies within
our interval at the 95% confidence level.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If we resampled our original sample and
calculated the proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China in
our resample, there is approximately a 95% chance our interval would
contain this number.</p>
<p>The second option is the only correct answer because it accurately
describes the process and interpretation of a bootstrap confidence
interval. A 95% bootstrapped confidence interval means that if we
repeatedly sampled from our original sample and constructed the interval
each time, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true
parameter. This statement does not imply that the true proportion has a
95% chance of falling within any single interval we construct; instead,
it reflects the long-run proportion of such intervals that would contain
the true proportion if we could repeat the process indefinitely. Thus,
the confidence interval gives us a method to estimate the parameter with
a specified level of confidence based on the resampling procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> True</p>
<p>The statement is true because the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies
to the sampling distribution of the proportion, given that the sample
size is large enough, which in our case, with 163 medals, it is. The CLT
asserts that the distribution of the sample mean (or proportion, in our
case) will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size grows,
allowing the use of standard methods to create confidence intervals.
Therefore, a CLT-based confidence interval is appropriate for estimating
the true proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China.</p>

<p>This is false, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis because

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> True</p>
<p>Lowering the significance level means that you require more evidence
to reject the null hypothesis, thus seeking a higher confidence in your
interval estimate. A higher confidence level corresponds to a wider
interval because it must encompass a larger range of values to ensure
that it contains the true population parameter with the increased
probability. Thus as we lower the significance level, the interval we

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False</p>
<p>This statement is false. A small significance level lowers the chance
of getting a statistically significant result; our value for 0.01
significance has to be outside a 99% confidence interval to be
statistically significant. In addition, the true parameter was already
contained within the tighter 95% confidence interval, so we failed to
reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. This
guarantees failing to reject the null hypotehsis at the 0.01
significance level since we know that whatever is contained in a 95%
confidence interval has to also be contained in a 99% confidence
interval. Thus, this answer is false.</p>

<p>We know that when Aaron reaches the mean (50), exactly 0.5 of the
mountain’s area is behind him, since the mean and median are equal for
normal distributions like this one. We also see that 54 is one half of a
standard deviation away from the mean. So, all we have to do is find out
what proportion of the area is within half a standard deviation of the
mean. Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, we know that 68% of the values lie
within one standard deviation of the mean to both the right and left
side. So, this means 34% of the values are within one standard deviation
on one side and at least 17% are within half a standard deviation on one
side. Since the area is 1, the area would be 0.17. So, by the time Aaron
reaches an x-coordinate of 54, <span class="math inline">0.5 + 0.17 =
0.67</span> of the mountain is behind him. From here, we simply
calculate the area in front by <span class="math inline">1 - 0.67 =
0.33</span>, so we conclude that approximately 0.3 of the area is in
front of Aaron.</p>
<p>Note: As a clafrification, the 0.17 is an estimate, specifically, an
underestimate, due to the shape of the normal distribution. Thse area
under a normal distribution is not proportional to how many standard
deviations far away from the mean you are.</p>

<p>Birgit Fischer-Schmidt is a German canoe paddler who set many
records, including being the only woman to win Olympic medals 24 years
apart.</p>
<p>Below is a DataFrame with information about all <strong>12 Olympic
medals</strong> she has won. There are only 10 rows but 12 medals
represented, because there are some years in which she won more than one
medal of the same type.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}</span></p>
<p>Reading the prompt we can see that we are solving for a conditional
probability. Let A be the given condition that the medal is gold and let
B be the event that a medal is from 2000. Looking at the DataFrame we
can see that 8 total gold medals are earned (make sure you pay attention
to the count column). Out of these 8 medals, 2 of them are from the year
2000. Thus, we obtain the probability <span class="math inline">\frac{2}{8}</span> or <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span></p>
<p>Here we can recognize that we are solving for the probability of a
union of two events. Let A be the event that the medal is gold. Let B be
the event that it is earned while representing East Germany. The
probability formula for a union is <span class="math inline">P(A \cup B)
= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)</span>. Looking at the DataFrame, we know
<span class="math inline">P(A)=\frac{8}{12}</span>, <span class="math inline">P(B)=\frac{4}{12}</span>, and <span class="math inline">P(A \cap B)=\frac{3}{12}</span>. Plugging all of
this into the formula, we get <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{12}+\frac{4}{12}-\frac{3}{12}=\frac{9}{12}=\frac{3}{4}</span>.
Thus, the correct answer is <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{22}</span></p>
<p>In this problem, we are sampling 2 medals without replacement. Let A
be the event that the first medal is from 1988 and let <span class="math inline">P(B)</span> be the event that the second medal is
from 1988. <span class="math inline">P(A)</span> is <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{12}</span> since there are 3 medals from

are sampling without replacement, the medal that we just sampled is no
longer in our pool. Thus, <span class="math inline">P(B)</span> is now
<span class="math inline">\frac{2}{11}</span> since there are now 2
medals from 1988 from the remaining 11 total medals. The joint
probability <span class="math inline">P(A \cap B)</span> is <span class="math inline">P(A)P(B)</span> so, plugging these values in, we get

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 110</p>
<p>We can estimate the number of males included in the third bin (from
80 to 100) by multiplying the area of that particular histogram bar by
the total number of males. The bar has a height of around 0.013 and a
width of 20, so the bar has an area of <span class="math inline">0.013
\cdot 20 = 0.26</span>, which means 26% of males fall in that bin. Since
there are 425 total males, <span class="math inline">0.26 \cdot 425 ≈
110</span> males are in that bin, rounded to the nearest multiple of

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
<code>males[(males.get("Weight")&gt;=80) &amp; (males.get("Weight")&lt;100)].shape[0]</code></p>
<p>To get the exact number of males in the third bin (from 80 to 100)
using code, we can query the males DataFrame to only include rows where
<code>"Weight"</code> is greater than or equal to 80, and
<code>"Weight"</code> is less than 100. Remember, a histogram bin
includes the lower bound (in this case, 80) and excludes the upper bound
(in this case, 100). Remember to put parentheses around each condition,
or else the order of operations will change your intended conditions.
After querying, we use <code>.shape[0]</code> to get the number of rows
in that dataframe, therefore getting the number of males with a weight
greater than or equal to 80, and less than 100.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> between <span class="math inline">0.5</span>
and <span class="math inline">0.75</span></p>
<p>We can answer this question by calculating the approximate number of
males and females in the first bin (from 40 to 60). Be careful, we
cannot simply compare the areas of the bars because the number of male
weightlifting medalists is different from the number of female
weightlifting medalists. The approximate number of male weightlifting
medalists is equal to <span class="math inline">0.008 \cdot 20 \cdot 425
= 68</span>, while the approximate number of female weightlifting
medalists is equal to <span class="math inline">0.021 \cdot 20 \cdot 105
= 44</span>. The proportion of male weightlifting medalists who weigh
less than 69 kg is approximately <span class="math inline">\frac{68}{68
+ 44} = 0.607</span>, which falls in the category of “between 0.5 and
0.75”.</p>
