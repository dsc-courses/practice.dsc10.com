<p>DSC 10’s only prerequisite is high school algebra. In order to gauge
your preparedness for the type of math you’ll see in this class, you
should work through the following practice problems on your own. You
will not submit it, and it will not be graded, but it will help you
identify any gaps in your background knowledge and it will teach you
some useful test-taking skills. Solutions will be posted here on
Wednesday, April 3.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 40%</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this. One way is to simplify the fraction.
The numerator, 16, and the denominator, 40, are both divisible by 4, so
the fraction is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{10}</span>, which is same as <span class="math inline">\frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>
<p>Another way is to solve the equation <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40} = \frac{x}{100}</span>. We can solve
this equation for <span class="math inline">x</span> by multiplying both
sides by 100, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{1600}{40}</span>. Since both the numerator and denominator end in
0, we can divide both by 10, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{160}{4}</span>, or <span class="math inline">x = 40</span>.</p>
<p>We can also solve this by recognizing that <span class="math inline">40 \cdot 2.5 = 100</span>. Therefore if we also
multiply the numerator of 16 by 2.5, we will convert <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40}</span> to its corresponding fraction
out of 100, which is <span class="math inline">\frac{16 \cdot 2.5}{40
\cdot 2.5} = \frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>

<p>A bicycle shop is going out of business and has a 30% discount on all

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 58%</p>
<p>The going-out-of-business discount is a 30% discount, which means I
will pay 70% of the original cost of a bicycle. If I use my coupon to
get 40% off, this means I will pay only 60% of that already-discounted
amount. 60% of 70% is 42% of the original cost, which we obtain by
multiplying 0.6 <span class="math inline">\cdot</span> 0.7 = 0.42. This
corresponds to a 58% discount off the original price. So I can get the
mattress for less than half its original price when combining both
discounts!</p>
<p>Notice that 40% off on top of 30% off does not equal 70% off.
Percentages don’t add in this way, they multiply. An easy way to see
this is if you took 50% off on top of 50% off. That would be half price
of half price, which is a quarter of the original price. Your discount
would be 75%, not 50% + 50% = 100%. That would be too good to be
true!</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{8}</span></p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">150 + 850 + 200 = 1200</span>
available parking spaces on Wednesday. 150 of these are in Gilman. So
the proportion we’re looking for is <span class="math inline">\frac{150}{1200}</span>. To simplify this, we look
for common factors in the numerator and denominator. Both 150 and 1200
end in 0, which means they are both divisible by 10. If we cancel out
the common factor of 10 from the numerator and denominator, we can
simplify the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{15}{120}</span>. This can be further
simplified. Since 15 has factors of 3 and 5, let’s look for factors of
those numbers in the denominator of 120. It turns out that both are
factors, but suppose we first notice that 3 is a factor of 120. This
simplifies the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{15}{120} =
\frac{5}{40}</span>. Then we could notice that 40 is a multiple of 5,
and simplify the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{8}</span>.</p>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 825</p>
<p>First, we use the Gilman column of the table to compute that on
average, there are 165 available spaces. We can compute this average
quickly without calculation by noticing that 150 and 180 are both
equally far from 165 on a number line, so the average of 180, 150, and
165 must be 165. Since 80% of Gilman is full on average, this means 20%
of Gilman is not full on average. We have figured out that 20% of
capacity is 165 parking spaces, which we can write as <span class="math inline">0.2x = 165</span>, or equivalently, <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5}x = 165</span>, where <span class="math inline">x</span> is the capacity of Gilman. Writing 0.2 as
the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5}</span> makes it
easier to solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by hand without a
calculator. We can solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by
multiplying both sides by 5, so the answer is <span class="math inline">165 \cdot 5</span>, which can do using long
multiplication to get 825.</p>
<p>If we want to avoid using long multiplication, we can use a trick: to
multiply by five, multiply by ten and divide by two, both of which are
pretty easy to do. <span class="math inline">165 \cdot 10 = 1650</span>
and half of that is 825. So, there are 825 parking spaces in Gilman.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 1400</p>
<p>Let’s start with Pangea since we know more information about that
facility. On Monday, 190 out of 950 parking spaces in Pangea are
available, which means <span class="math inline">950 - 190 = 760</span>
parking spaces are occupied. The percentage of occupied spaces in Pangea
is <span class="math inline">\frac{760}{950} \cdot 100\% = 80\%</span>.
We’re told that is twice the percentage of occupied spaces in Hopkins,
so that means Hopkins must be 40% full. There are 840 available spaces
in Hopkins on Monday. Since Hopkins is 40% full, these 840 unoccupied
spaces correspond to the remaining 60% of spaces in Hopkins. If <span class="math inline">x</span> is the capacity of Hopkins, we have <span class="math inline">0.6x = 840</span>. We can solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by dividing both sides by 0.6 to obtain
<span class="math inline">x = 1400</span>. So, there are 1400 parking
spaces in Hopkins.</p>

<h2 id="problem-7">Problem 7</h2>
<p>Every year, San Diego’s Regional Task Force on Homelessness conducts
a “point-in-time” count of the number of homeless individuals in San
Diego County. They send out a team of over a thousand volunteers to
locate and count homeless individuals throughout the county’s shelters,
streets, encampments, cars, etc. In 2023, newspapers reported that the
count increased by 22% from the 2022 count. Part of that increase was
explained by the fact that for the first time, volunteers were able to
access and count people on Caltrans property. It was also reported that
if we were to exclude the people who were counted on Caltrans property,
the count would have still increased by 14%, meaning that the additional
area covered could not explain all of the increase from one year’s count
to the next. The 2023 point-in-time count was 10,264 individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 673</p>
<p>We are told that 10,264 homeless individuals were counted in 2023 and
that this was a 22% increase from the 2022 count. We can use this
information to find the 2022 count, which we will call <span class="math inline">x</span>. Since <span class="math inline">1.22x =
10{,}264</span>, we can divide both sides by 1.22 to find that the 2022
count was 8413. The 2023 count of people excluding those counted on
Caltrans property is 14% higher than this number, which is <span class="math inline">1.14 \cdot 8413 = 9591</span>. The difference
between the total 2023 count and the count excluding those on Caltrans
property is therefore <span class="math inline">10{,}264 - 9591 =
673</span>.</p>
<p>Here is another way to solve this problem without actually
calculating the 2022 count. Again, let <span class="math inline">x</span> represent the 2022 count. We want to find
the difference between the full 2023 count, which is <span class="math inline">1.22x</span>, and the 2023 count without those
counted on Caltrans property, which is <span class="math inline">1.14x</span>. Therefore, we need to find <span class="math inline">1.22x - 1.14x = 0.08x</span>. We know <span class="math inline">1.22x = 10{,}264</span> as before. So, <span class="math inline">x = \frac{10{,}264}{1.22}</span> and <span class="math inline">0.08x = 0.08 \cdot \frac{10{,}264}{1.22} =

(22 and 14), it gave them as whole numbers even though the actual
percent increases could not have been whole numbers.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">x</span> represents the 2022 count, then
based on the informtion given in the question, we have <span class="math inline">1.22x = 10{,}264</span>. The exact solution to this
equation is actually <span class="math inline">x = 8413.1147541</span>,
but since <span class="math inline">x</span> represents a count of
people, it must be a whole number. This means the 1.22 number in this
equation is an approximation, because it’s easier (both to report and to
interpret) a percent increase that is a whole number and not a
decimal.</p>

<h2 id="problem-8">Problem 8</h2>
<p>At a furniture store, suppose every item has a “true value” that
represents its worth. Every item in the store has a ticketed price,
which is the amount that is printed on the item’s price tag that
customers will pay, that is 25% higher its true value. The store wants
its employees to be able to buy items at their true value. What percent
discount does it need to give its employees off the ticketed price to
accomplish this?</p>
<p>In general, if a store marks up prices by <span
class="math inline">p</span>%, what percent discount does it need to
give to employees off the ticketed price so that they can buy things at
the true value?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 20%, or more generally, <span class="math inline">\frac{100p}{100+p}\%</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">v</span> represent the true value of an
item in the furniture store. The store sells the item for <span class="math inline">v</span> + 25% of <span class="math inline">v</span>, which can be expressed as <span class="math inline">1.25v</span>. We’ll call this the ticketed price,
which is the amount that would be printed on the item’s price tag.</p>
<p>Now, just to demonstrate the kind of calculation involved, let’s say
the store provides employees with a 25% discount. This would mean that
employees pay <span class="math inline">100\% - 25\% = 75\%</span> of
the ticketed price, which is <span class="math inline">0.75 \cdot
1.25v</span>. This simplifies to <span class="math inline">0.9375v</span>, which is less than the true value
<span class="math inline">v</span>. This means a 25% employee discount
is too much of a discount, since it allows employees to buy items at
less than the true value. Since the ticketed price is 25% more than the
true value, 25% of the ticketed price is larger than 25% of the true
value; since the employee discount is taken off of the ticketed price,
it needs to be less than 25%.</p>
<p>The question, then, is what percentage discount should the store
provide to employees so that the post-discount price is equal to <span class="math inline">v</span>? Suppose they provide employees with a
discount of <span class="math inline">d</span>, where <span class="math inline">d</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1 (in the
previous example, for instance, it would have been 0.25, which
corresponds to 25%). Then, employees pay <span class="math inline">(1 -
d) \cdot 1.25v</span>. Now, we need to pick the value of <span class="math inline">d</span> that makes <span class="math inline">(1 -
d) \cdot 1.25v</span> equal to <span class="math inline">v</span>. Let’s
set up an equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">(1 - d) \cdot 1.25v = v</span></p>
<p>We need to solve this for <span class="math inline">d</span>, and
fortunately, if we divide both sides by <span class="math inline">v</span>, this becomes an equation with just one
variable, which we can solve with algebra:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}(1 - d) \cdot 1.25 &amp;= 1
\\ 1 - d &amp;= \frac{1}{1.25} \\ d &amp;= 1 - \frac{1}{1.25}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">1.25 = \frac{5}{4}</span>, we
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">d = 1 - \frac{1}{1.25} = 1 -
\frac{1}{\frac{5}{4}} = 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5}</span></p>
<p>This means that the store needs to give employees a discount of <span class="math inline">d = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2</span>, or 20%, in order for
their post-discount price to be equal to the true value of the item
they’re buying.</p>
<p>More generally, if a store sells an item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value, <span class="math inline">v</span>, then the ticketed price is <span class="math inline">\left(1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)v</span>, or <span class="math inline">\left(\frac{100 + p}{100}\right)v</span>. For
instance, if <span class="math inline">p = 25</span>, then the ticketed
price is <span class="math inline">\frac{100 + 25}{100}v = 1.25v</span>,
which we saw before. Then, the store would need to offer employees a
discount of <span class="math inline">d</span> (where <span class="math inline">d</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1) such that
<span class="math inline">(1 - d) \cdot \frac{100 + p}{100} = 1</span>.
Solving for <span class="math inline">d</span> gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*} (1 - d) \cdot \frac{100 +
p}{100} &amp;= 1 \\ 1 - d &amp;= \frac{100}{100 + p} \\ d &amp;= 1 -
\frac{100}{100 + p} \\ d &amp;= \frac{100 + p}{100 + p} - \frac{100}{100
+ p} \\ d &amp;= \frac{p}{100 + p} \end{align*}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p}</span> is a decimal
between 0 and 1, so to convert it to a percentage we can multiply it by
<span class="math inline">100\%</span>. To conclude, if a store sells an
item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value,
<span class="math inline">v</span>, then they must offer employees a
discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p} \cdot
100\%</span> in order for their post-discount price to be equal to <span class="math inline">v</span>.</p>
<p>This is a scary-looking formula, but let’s try it in action: if we
let <span class="math inline">p</span> be 25, as it was in the first
part of this question, we then have a discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{25}{100 + 25} \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">0.2 \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">20\%</span>.</p>

<p>One of your classes this quarter, PTS 1: <em>Principles of Taylor
Swift</em>, has the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>20% Midterm 1</li>
<li>20% Midterm 2</li>
<li>30% Homeworks (lowest homework dropped)</li>
<li>30% Final Exam</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 homework assignments, but your lowest homework score is
dropped from your overall grade calculation. Each homework assignment is
worth the same amount in your overall grade calculation, even though
they have different numbers of available points. Your scores on all
parts of the course, before the Final Exam, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: <span class="math inline">\frac{98}{100}</span></li>
<li>Midterm 2: <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{38}</span></li>
<li>Homework 1: <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span></li>

<li>Homework 3: <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{10}</span></li>
<li>Homework 4: <span class="math inline">\frac{12}{13}</span></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the minimum possible score you can earn on the Final Exam,

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 87.5%</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">f</span> be your Final Exam score in
PTS 1, as a decimal between 0 and 1. (We’ll treat <span class="math inline">f</span> as a decimal because all of your other
scores are provided to us as decimals, or fractions, as well.) If we
knew <span class="math inline">f</span>, we could calculate your overall
grade right now:</p>
<p><span class="math display">20\% \cdot \text{Midterm 1} + 20\% \cdot
\text{Midterm 2} + 30\% \cdot \text{Homeworks} + 30\% \cdot f</span></p>
<p>We don’t know <span class="math inline">f</span>, but we do know the
other variables in the above expression. Your Midterm Exam scores are
given to us directly, but your average score on homeworks, after
dropping your lowest homework, requires a bit of calculation to find.
First, we need to find which of the four homeworks you did the worst on,
so that we can exclude it when calculating your average homework score.
That happens to be Homework 2, which you scored a 72% on; we can find
this without a calculator by noticing that <span class="math inline">25
\cdot 4 = 100</span>, so <span class="math inline">\frac{18}{25} =
\frac{18 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{72}{100} = 72\%</span>. This is
lower than Homework 1, which you scored a <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4} = 75\%</span> on; Homework 3, which you
scored a <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{10} = 90\%</span> on, and
Homework 4, which you scored a <span class="math inline">\frac{12}{13} =
92.3\%</span> on (<span class="math inline">\frac{12}{13}</span> is a
tough fraction to simplify without a calculator, but you don’t need to,
since has to be greater than <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{10}</span> which you know is 90%, and thus
it has to be greater than 72%).</p>
<p>This means that the three homework scores that we’re going to include
in your average homework score calculation are <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span>, <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{10}</span>, and <span class="math inline">\frac{12}{13}</span>. Note that we’re using the
fractional forms rather than something like 92.3% because there’s no
need to round at this stage. The average of these three fractions is
<span class="math inline">\frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4} +
\frac{9}{10} + \frac{12}{13}\right)</span>; the result is your average
homework score. We’ll leave it like this for now so that you only need
to put one (big) expression in the calculator.</p>
<p>Now that we have your average homework score, we know most parts of
your overall grade:</p>
<p><span class="math display">20\% \cdot \frac{98}{100} + 20\% \cdot
\frac{16}{38} + 30\% \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4} +
\frac{9}{10} + \frac{12}{13}\right) + 30\% \cdot f</span></p>
<p>Simplifying everything before <span class="math inline">30\% \cdot
f</span> in a calculator gives us 53.75%.</p>
<p>It’s worth commenting on <em>how</em> to evaluate such an expression
in a calculator. It’s easier to treat percentages, like 20%, as
decimals, like 0.2, when using a calculator.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=0.2+*+(98%2F100)+%2B+0.2+*+(16%2F38)+%2B+0.3+*+(3%2F4+%2B+9%2F10+%2B+12%2F13)+%2F+3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Here</a>
you can see the exact expression we typed into a Google search (no need
to use a physical calculator!); 0.5375… is the same as 53.75..%.</p>
<p>Now, we have that your overall grade is</p>
<p><span class="math display">53.75\% + 30\% \cdot f</span></p>
<p>We need to find the smallest value of <span class="math inline">f</span> such that your overall grade is at least
80%, or in other words, the smallest value of <span class="math inline">f</span> that satisfies the inequality</p>
<p><span class="math display">53.75\% + 30\% \cdot f \geq
80\%</span></p>
<p>Let’s solve:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*} 53.75\% + 30\% \cdot f
&amp;\geq 80\% \\ 30\% \cdot f &amp;\geq 26.25\% \\ f &amp;\geq
\frac{26.25}{30} \\ f &amp;\geq 0.875 \end{align*}</span></p>
<p>So, to earn a B in PTS 1, you’ll need at least an 87.5% on the Final
Exam. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 30 minutes</p>
<p>To actually solve this problem requires a bit of math, but it turns
out we can narrow it down to the correct answer using the process of
elimination and some common sense. First of all, some of these answers
are tempting because they come naturally from the numbers given in the
problem. For example, 125 minutes is the sum of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. Likewise, 62.5 minutes is the average of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. But does it make sense to sum or average the times? No! Think
of it this way: there is a fixed amount of work to be done (grade 150
homeworks). Working alone, the professor can knock out that task in 50
minutes. With help, the professor will finish the task even faster. So
the answer must be less than 50 minutes.</p>
<p>That leaves two options: 25 minutes and 30 minutes. Notice that 25
minutes is half the time it would take for the professor to grade the
homeworks alone. If the professor were able to clone themself, then the
two professors could grade the homeworks in 25 minutes, working double
the speed of one professor. But the TA is not quite as fast as a second
professor. So it will take more than 25 minutes for one professor and
one TA to complete the grading. This leaves only one answer that can
make sense, so the answer must be 30 minutes. We can solve the problem
without doing any math!</p>
<p>It’s always good to double-check that our answer is correct. Let’s
actually solve this problem using math now. To start, we know that the
professor grades at a rate of 150 homeworks per 50 minutes, which is 3
homeworks per minute because <span class="math inline">\frac{150}{50} =
\frac{3}{1}</span>. The TA grades 150 homeworks per 75 minutes, or 2
homeworks per minute. This means that in one minute, the professor can
grade 3 homeworks and the TA can grade 2 homeworks, for a total of 5
homeworks.</p>
<p>When working together, the professor and TA grade at a rate of 5
homeworks per minute. So how much time do they need to grade 150
homeworks? 5 homeworks per minute is equivalent to 150 homeworks per 30
minutes, since <span class="math inline">\frac{5}{1} =
\frac{150}{30}</span>. Therefore, it takes them 30 minutes to complete
their grading task, the same result we obtained through process of
elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 355, or more generally, <span class="math inline">m-n+1</span></p>
<p>It might help to visualize the problem, as in the image below.</p>
<center><img src="../assets/images/pretest/spreadsheet.jpg" width="40%"/></center>
<p>One way to solve this problem is to count the rows and look for a
pattern. Row 543 is row 1 of the highlighted section. Row 544 is row 2
of the highlighted section. Row 545 is row 3 of the highlighted section.
The pattern seems to be that row <span class="math inline">x</span> is
row <span class="math inline">x</span> - 542 of the highlighted section.
Therefore, with <span class="math inline">x</span> = 897, row 897 is row
355 of the highlighted section. Since this is the last row of the
highlighted section, there are 355 rows highlighted.</p>
<p>Let’s also think about the problem a different way. Imagine we had
highlighted all the rows up to and including row 897. That would mean we
had highlighted 897 rows. But we actually highlighted 542 fewer rows
than this (since the first highlighted row was row 543, the first 542
rows were not highlighted). So the total number of highlighted rows is
897 - 542 = 355.</p>
<p>In general, imagine highlighting all <span class="math inline">m</span> rows up to an including row <span class="math inline">m</span>. That would be <span class="math inline">m</span> highlighted rows. But if we only start
highlighting at row <span class="math inline">n</span>, this includes
<span class="math inline">n-1</span> rows that should not be counted. So
there are <span class="math inline">m-(n-1) = m - n + 1</span> rows
highlighted when we highlight rows <span class="math inline">n</span>
