<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 40%</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this. One way is to simplify the fraction.
The numerator, 16, and the denominator, 40, are both divisible by 4, so
the fraction is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{10}</span>, which is same as <span class="math inline">\frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>
<p>Another way is to solve the equation <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40} = \frac{x}{100}</span>. We can solve
this equation for <span class="math inline">x</span> by multiplying both
sides by 100, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{1600}{40}</span>. Since both the numerator and denominator end in
0, we can divide both by 10, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{160}{4}</span>, or <span class="math inline">x = 40</span>.</p>
<p>We can solve this by recognizing that <span class="math inline">40
\cdot 2.5 = 100</span>. Therefore if we also multiply the numerator of
16 by 2.5, we will convert <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40}</span> to its corresponding fraction
out of 100, which is <span class="math inline">\frac{16 \cdot 2.5}{40
\cdot 2.5} = \frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>

<!-- <topics>arithmetic, fractions</topics> -->
<p>A mattress store is going out of business and has a 30% discount on

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 58%</p>
<p>The going-out-of-business discount is a 30% discount, which means I
will pay 70% of the original cost of a mattress. If I use my coupon to
get 40% off, this means I will pay only 60% of that already-discounted
amount. 60% of 70% is 42% of the original cost, which we obtain by
multiplying <span class="math inline">0.6 \cdot 0.7=0.42</span>. This
corresponds to a 58% discount off the original price. So I can get the
mattress for less than half its original price when combining both
discounts!</p>
<p>Notice that 40% off on top of 30% off does not equal 70% off.
Percentages don’t add in this way, they multiply. An easy way to see
this is if you took 50% off on top of 50% off. That would be half price
of half price, which is a quarter of the original price. Your discount
would be 75%, not <span class="math inline">50\%+50\% = 100\%</span>.
That would be too good to be true!</p>

<h2 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h2>
<p>At a furniture store, suppose every item has a “true value” that
represents its worth. Every item in the store is marked up by 25%, so
it’s sold at a price higher than its true value for the store to make a
profit. But the store wants its employees to be able to buy items at
their true value. What percent discount does it need to give its
employees off the sale price to accomplish this?</p>
<p>In general, if a store marks up prices by <span
class="math inline">p</span>%, what percent discount does it need to
give to employees so that they can buy things at the true value?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 20%, or more generally, <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100+p} \cdot 100\%</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">t</span> represent the true value of an
item in the furniture store. The store sells the item for <span class="math inline">t</span> + 25% of <span class="math inline">t</span>, which can be expressed as <span class="math inline">1.25t</span>.</p>
<p>Now, just to demonstrate the kind of calculation involved, let’s say
the store provides employees with a 25% discount. This would mean that
employees pay <span class="math inline">100\% - 25\% = 75\%</span> of
the sale price, which is <span class="math inline">0.75 \cdot
1.25t</span>. This simplifies to <span class="math inline">0.9375t</span>, which is less than <span class="math inline">t</span>, which means that 25% is too much of a
discount! Since the sale price is 25% more than the true value, 25% of
the sale price is more than 25% of the true value; since the employee
discount is taken off of the sale price, it needs to be less than
25%.</p>
<p>The question, then, is what percentage discount should the store
provide employees with so that the post-discount sale price is equal to
<span class="math inline">t</span>? Suppose they provide employees with
a discount of <span class="math inline">e</span>, where <span class="math inline">e</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1 (in the
previous example, for instance, it would have been 0.25, which
corresponds to 25%). Then, employees pay <span class="math inline">(1 -
e) \cdot 1.25t</span>. Now, we need to pick the value of <span class="math inline">e</span> that makes <span class="math inline">(1 -
e) \cdot 1.25t</span> equal to <span class="math inline">t</span>. This
is equivalent to picking the value of <span class="math inline">e</span>
that makes <span class="math inline">(1 - e) \cdot 1.25</span> equal to
1. Let’s solve:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}(1 - e) \cdot 1.25 &amp;= 1
\\ 1 - e &amp;= \frac{1}{1.25} \\ e &amp;= 1 - \frac{1}{1.25}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">1.25 = \frac{5}{4}</span>, we
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">e = 1 - \frac{1}{1.25} = 1 -
\frac{1}{\frac{5}{4}} = 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5}</span></p>
<p>This means that the store needs to give employees a discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5} = 0.2</span>, or 20%, in order for their
post-discount price to be equal to the true value of the item they’re
buying.</p>
<p>More generally, if a store sells an item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value, <span class="math inline">t</span>, then its sale price is <span class="math inline">\left(1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)t</span>, or <span class="math inline">\frac{100 + p}{100}t</span> (for instance, if <span class="math inline">p = 25</span>, then the sale price is <span class="math inline">\frac{100 + 25}{100}t = 1.25t</span>, which we saw
before). Then, the store would need to offer employees a discount of
<span class="math inline">e</span> (where <span class="math inline">e</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1) such that
<span class="math inline">(1 - e) \cdot \frac{100 + p}{100} = 1</span>.
Solving for <span class="math inline">e</span> gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*} (1 - e) \cdot \frac{100 +
p}{100} &amp;= 1 \\ 1 - e &amp;= \frac{100}{100 + p} \\ e &amp;= 1 -
\frac{100}{100 + p} \\ e &amp;= \frac{100 + p}{100 + p} - \frac{100}{100
+ p} \\ e &amp;= \frac{p}{100 + p} \end{align*}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p}</span> is a decimal
between 0 and 1, so to convert it to a percentage we can multiply it by
<span class="math inline">100\%</span>. To conclude, if a store sells an
item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value,
<span class="math inline">t</span>, then they must offer employees a
discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p} \cdot
100\%</span> in order for their post-discount price to be equal to <span class="math inline">t</span>.</p>
<p>This is a scary looking formula, but let’s try it in action: if we
let <span class="math inline">p</span> be 25, as it was in the first
part of this question, we then have a discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{25}{100 + 25} \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">0.2 \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">20\%</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 30 minutes</p>
<p>To actually solve this problem requires a bit of math, but it turns
out we can narrow it down to the correct answer using the process of
elimination and some common sense. First of all, some of these answers
are tempting because they come naturally from the numbers given in the
problem. For example, 125 minutes is the sum of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. Likewise, 62.5 minutes is the average of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. But does it make sense to sum or average the times? No! Think
of it this way: there is a fixed amount of work to be done (grade 150
quizzes). Working alone, the professor can knock out that task in 50
minutes. With help, the professor will finish the task even faster. So
the answer must be less than 50 minutes.</p>
<p>That leaves two options: 25 minutes and 30 minutes. Notice that 25
minutes is half the time it would take for the professor to grade the
quizzes alone. If the professor were able to clone themself, then the
two professors could grade the quizzes in 25 minutes, working double the
speed of one professor. But the TA is not quite as fast as a second
professor. So it will take more than 25 minutes for one professor and
one TA to complete the grading. This leaves only one answer that can
make sense, so the answer must be 30 minutes. We can solve the problem
without doing any math!</p>
<p>It’s always good to double-check that our answer is correct. Let’s
actually solve this problem using math now. To start, we know that the
professor grades at a rate of 150 quizzes per 50 minutes, which is 3
quizzes per minute because <span class="math inline">\frac{150}{50} =
\frac{3}{1}</span>. The TA grades 150 quizzes per 75 minutes, or 2
quizzes per minute. This means that in one minute, the professor can
grade 3 quizzes and the TA can grade 2 quizzes, for a total of 5
quizzes.</p>
<p>When working together, the professor and TA grade at a rate of 5
quizzes per minute. So how much time do they need to grade 150 quizzes?
5 quizzes per minute is equivalent to 150 quizzes per 30 minutes, since
<span class="math inline">\frac{5}{1} = \frac{150}{30}</span>.
Therefore, it takes them 30 minutes to complete their grading task, as
we obtained through process of elimination.</p>

<h2 id="problem-8">Problem 8</h2>
<p>Every year, San Diego’s Regional Task Force on Homelessness conducts
a “point-in-time” count of the minimum number of homeless individuals in
San Diego County. They send out a team of over a thousand volunteers to
locate and count homeless people throughout the county’s shelters,
streets, encampments, cars, etc. In 2023, newspapers reported that the
count increased by 22% from the 2022 count. Part of that increase was
explained by the fact that for the first time, volunteers were able to
access and count people on Caltrans property. It was also reported that
if we were to exclude the people who were counted on Caltrans property,
the count would have still increased by 14%, meaning that the additional
area covered could not explain all of the increase from one year’s count
to the next. The 2023 point-in-time count was 10,264 individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 673</p>
<p>We are told that 10,264 homeless individuals were counted in 2023 and
that this was a 22% increase from the 2022 count. We can use this
information to find the 2022 count, which we will call <span class="math inline">x</span>. Since <span class="math inline">1.22x =
10{,}264</span>, we can divide both sides by 1.22 to find that the 2022
count was 8413. The 2023 count of people excluding those counted on
Caltrans property is 14% higher than this number, which is <span class="math inline">1.14 \cdot 8413 = 9591</span>. The difference
between the total 2023 count and the count excluding those on Caltrans
property is therefore <span class="math inline">10{,}264 - 9591 =
673</span>.</p>
<p>Here is another way to solve this problem without actually
calculating the 2022 count. Again, let <span class="math inline">x</span> represent the 2022 count. We want to find
the difference between the full 2023 count, which is <span class="math inline">1.22x</span>, and the 2023 count without those
counted on Caltrans property, which is <span class="math inline">1.14x</span>. Therefore, we need to find <span class="math inline">1.22x - 1.14x = 0.08x</span>. We know <span class="math inline">1.22x = 10{,}264</span> as before. So, <span class="math inline">x = \frac{10{,}264}{1.22}</span> and <span class="math inline">0.08x = 0.08 \cdot \frac{10{,}264}{1.22} =
673</span>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-8.3">Problem 8.3</h3>
<p>The actual number of individuals counted on Caltrans property in 2023
was 661, which should be close to your answer to the previous question,
but not exactly the same. Did the newspapers make a mistake or is there
another explanation for the discrepancy?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The discrepancy is most likely due to
rounding. Notice that when the newspaper reported the percent increases
(22 and 14), it gave them as whole numbers even though the actual
percent increases could not have been whole numbers.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">x</span> represents the 2022 count, then
we set up the equation <span class="math inline">1.22x =
10{,}264</span>. The exact solution to this equation is actually <span class="math inline">x = 8413.1147541</span>, but since <span class="math inline">x</span> represents a count of people, it must be a
whole number. This means the 1.22 number in this equation is an
approximation, because it’s easier (both to report and to interpret) a
percent increase that is a whole number and not a decimal.</p>

<p>You plan to drive to campus for your Monday, Wednesday, Friday

parking options available. The table below shows how many unoccupied
spaces there are in each parking structure at 10am on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday of Week 1.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{8}</span></p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">150 + 850 + 200 = 1200</span>
available parking spaces on Wednesday. 150 of these are in Gilman. So
the proportion we’re looking for is <span class="math inline">\frac{150}{1200}</span>. To simplify this, we look
for common factors in the numerator and denominator. Both 150 and 1200
end in 0, which means they are both divisible by 10. If we cancel out
the common factor of 10 from the numerator and denominator, we can
simplify the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{15}{120}</span>. This can be further
simplified. Since 15 has factors of 3 and 5, let’s look for factors of
those numbers in the denominator of 120. It turns out that both are
factors, but suppose we first notice that 3 is a factor of 120. This
simplifies the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{15}{120} =
\frac{5}{40}</span>. Then we could notice that 40 is a multiple of 5,
and simplify the proportion to <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{8}</span>.</p>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 825</p>
<p>First, we use the Gilman column of the table to compute that on
average, there are 165 available spaces. We can compute this average
quickly without calculation by noticing that 150 and 180 are both
equally far from 165 on a number line, so the average of 180, 150, and
165 must be 165. Since 80% of Gilman is full on average, this means 20%
of Gilman is not full on average. We have figured out that 20% of
capacity is 165 parking spaces, which we can write as <span class="math inline">0.2x = 165</span>, or equivalently, <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5}x = 165</span>, where <span class="math inline">x</span> is the capacity of Gilman. Writing 0.2 as
the fraction <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5}</span> makes it
easier to solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by hand without a
calculator. We can solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by
multiplying both sides by 5, so the answer is <span class="math inline">165 \cdot 5</span>, which can do using long
multiplication to get 825.</p>
<p>If we want to avoid using long multiplication, we can use a trick: to
multiply by five, multiply by ten and divide by two, both of which are
pretty easy to do. <span class="math inline">165 \cdot 10 = 1650</span>
and half of that is 825. So, there are 825 parking spaces in Gilman.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 1400</p>
<p>Let’s start with Pangea since we know more information about that
facility. On Monday, 190 out of 950 parking spaces in Pangea are
available, which means <span class="math inline">950 - 190 = 760</span>
parking spaces are occupied. The percentage of occupied spaces in Pangea
is <span class="math inline">\frac{760}{950} \cdot 100\% = 80\%</span>.
We’re told that is twice the percentage of occupied spaces in Hopkins,
so that means Hopkins must be 40% full. There are 840 available spaces
in Hopkins on Monday. Since Hopkins is 40% full, these 840 unoccupied
spaces correspond to the remaining 60% of spaces in Hopkins. If <span class="math inline">x</span> is the capacity of Hopkins, we have <span class="math inline">0.6x = 840</span>. We can solve for <span class="math inline">x</span> by dividing both sides by 0.6 to obtain
<span class="math inline">x = 1400</span>. So, there are 1400 parking
spaces in Hopkins.</p>

<h2 id="problem-10">Problem 10</h2>
<p>There are six different colors of M&amp;M candies: yellow, blue,
green, red, orange, and brown. You and your friend are playing a game.
You will pick five M&amp;Ms from a bag with your eyes closed. Your

yellow, green, or blue. Unfortunately, when you play this game, you

<p>To win the prize, you must select five M&amp;Ms and end up with no
yellow, no green, and no blue M&amp;Ms. Since you didn’t win the prize,
among your five selected M&amp;Ms, there must be at least one M&amp;M
that is yellow, blue, or green. That’s all we know for sure about the
five M&amp;Ms we selected. Now, let’s take a look at the options.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All five M&amp;M’s were the same color, either yellow, blue, or
green. <strong>May be true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below,
because both of them would fail to win you the prize. It’s possible that
all five candies were green (or yellow, or blue) but it’s not
necessarily the case.

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>All five M&amp;M’s were the same color, either red, orange, or
brown. <strong>Cannot be true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If this were true, the condition for winning the prize would be
satisfied: none of the candies you picked would be yellow, green, or
blue. So this cannot be true.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>All five M&amp;M’s were one of the following colors: yellow, blue,
green. <strong>May be true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below,
because both of them would fail to win you the prize. All we know is
that at least one of the candies has to be yellow, blue, or green. They
might all be those colors, or they might not.
</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>All five M&amp;M’s were one of the following colors: red, orange,
brown. <strong>Cannot be true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If all five candies were red, orange, or brown, such as in the
picture below, you would have actually won the prize. Since you didn’t
win the prize, that tells us this can’t be true.
</p>
<center><img src="../assets/images/pretest/candy5.jpg" width="50%"/></center>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>One or more M&amp;M’s was yellow, blue, or green. <strong>Must be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This has to be true, because if it were not true, you would have won
the prize. The opposite of “one or more” is “none” and the condition to
win the prize was that none of your candies could be yellow, blue, or
green.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>One or more M&amp;M’s was red, orange, or brown. <strong>May be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It could be the case that you had a red, orange, or brown candy among
your five, as in the first picture below. But you may have also not had
any red, orange, or browns, like in the second picture below. For both
groups of candies shown below, you would have failed to win the prize.
</p>

<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>None of the M&amp;M’s were yellow, blue, or green. <strong>Cannot be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is exactly the winning condition, but we know you did not win
the prize, so this cannot be true.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>None of the M&amp;M’s were red, orange, or brown. <strong>May be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You failed to win the prize because you had at least one candy that
was yellow, blue, or green. You may have had some red, orange, or brown
candies included among your five, or you may not have. Either of the two
groups of five below is possible, because you would not have won the
prize either way.
