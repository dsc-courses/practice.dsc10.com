<p>DSC 10’s only prerequisite is high school algebra. In order to gauge
your preparedness for the type of math you’ll see in this class, you
should work through the following practice problems on your own. You
will not submit it, and it will not be graded.</p>

<p>Express <span class="math inline">\frac{14}{9} \cdot

<!-- Then we can cancel a 7 and two 3s to get $2\cdot2\cdot2 = 8$. 

We can also do this one bit at a time by noticing common factors in the numerator and denominator. For example, we might simplify this as
$$\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} = \frac{42}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{21} = \frac{6}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 8.$$ -->

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 40%</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this. One way is to simplify the fraction.
The numerator, 16, and the denominator, 40, are both divisible by 4, so
the fraction is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\frac{4}{10}</span>, which is same as <span class="math inline">\frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>
<p>Another way is to solve the equation <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40} = \frac{x}{100}</span>. We can solve
this equation for <span class="math inline">x</span> by multiplying both
sides by 100, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{1600}{40}</span>. Since both the numerator and denominator end in
0, we can divide both by 10, to get <span class="math inline">x =
\frac{160}{4}</span>, or <span class="math inline">x = 40</span>.</p>
<p>We can solve this by recognizing that <span class="math inline">40
\cdot 2.5 = 100</span>. Therefore if we also multiply the numerator of
16 by 2.5, we will convert <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{40}</span> to its corresponding fraction
out of 100, which is <span class="math inline">\frac{16 \cdot 2.5}{40
\cdot 2.5} = \frac{40}{100}</span>, or 40%.</p>

<!-- <topics>arithmetic, fractions</topics> -->
<p>A mattress store is going out of business and has a 30% discount on

I use my coupon on top of the going-out-of-business discount?</p>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 58%</p>
<p>The going-out-of-business discount is a 30% discount, which means I
will pay 70% of the original cost of a mattress. If I use my coupon to
get 40% off, this means I will pay only 60% of that already-discounted
amount. 60% of 70% is 42% of the original cost, which we obtain by
multiplying <span class="math inline">0.6 \cdot 0.7=0.42</span>. This
corresponds to a 58% discount off the original price. So I can get the
mattress for less than half its original price when combining both
discounts!</p>
<p>Notice that 40% off on top of 30% off does not equal 70% off.
Percentages don’t add in this way, they multiply. An easy way to see
this is if you took 50% off on top of 50% off. That would be half price
of half price, which is a quarter of the original price. Your discount
would be 75%, not <span class="math inline">50\%+50\% = 100\%</span>.
That would be too good to be true!</p>

<h2 id="problem-5">Problem 5</h2>
<p>At a furniture store, suppose every item has a “true value” that
represents its worth. Every item in the store is marked up by 25%, so
it’s sold at a price higher than its true value for the store to make a
profit. But the store wants its employees to be able to buy items at
their true value. What percent discount does it need to give its
employees off the sale price to accomplish this?</p>
<p>In general, if a store marks up prices by <span
class="math inline">p</span>%, what percent discount does it need to
give to employees so that they can buy things at the true value?</p>

</header>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 20%, or more generally, <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100+p} \cdot 100\%</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">t</span> represent the true value of an
item in the furniture store. The store sells the item for <span class="math inline">t</span> + 25% of <span class="math inline">t</span>, which can be expressed as <span class="math inline">1.25t</span>.</p>
<p>Now, just to demonstrate the kind of calculation involved, let’s say
the store provides employees with a 25% discount. This would mean that
employees pay <span class="math inline">100\% - 25\% = 75\%</span> of
the sale price, which is <span class="math inline">0.75 \cdot
1.25t</span>. This simplifies to <span class="math inline">0.9375t</span>, which is less than <span class="math inline">t</span>, which means that 25% is too much of a
discount! Since the sale price is 25% more than the true value, 25% of
the sale price is more than 25% of the true value; since the employee
discount is taken off of the sale price, it needs to be less than
25%.</p>
<p>The question, then, is what percentage discount should the store
provide employees with so that the post-discount sale price is equal to
<span class="math inline">t</span>? Suppose they provide employees with
a discount of <span class="math inline">e</span>, where <span class="math inline">e</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1 (in the
previous example, for instance, it would have been 0.25, which
corresponds to 25%). Then, employees pay <span class="math inline">(1 -
e) \cdot 1.25t</span>. Now, we need to pick the value of <span class="math inline">e</span> that makes <span class="math inline">(1 -
e) \cdot 1.25t</span> equal to <span class="math inline">t</span>. This
is equivalent to picking the value of <span class="math inline">e</span>
that makes <span class="math inline">(1 - e) \cdot 1.25</span> equal to
1. Let’s solve:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}(1 - e) \cdot 1.25 &amp;= 1
\\ 1 - e &amp;= \frac{1}{1.25} \\ e &amp;= 1 - \frac{1}{1.25}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">1.25 = \frac{5}{4}</span>, we
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">e = 1 - \frac{1}{1.25} = 1 -
\frac{1}{\frac{5}{4}} = 1 - \frac{4}{5} = \frac{1}{5}</span></p>
<p>This means that the store needs to give employees a discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{5} = 0.2</span>, or 20%, in order for their
post-discount price to be equal to the true value of the item they’re
buying.</p>
<p>More generally, if a store sells an item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value, <span class="math inline">t</span>, then its sale price is <span class="math inline">\left(1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)t</span>, or <span class="math inline">\frac{100 + p}{100}t</span> (for instance, if <span class="math inline">p = 25</span>, then the sale price is <span class="math inline">\frac{100 + 25}{100}t = 1.25t</span>, which we saw
before). Then, the store would need to offer employees a discount of
<span class="math inline">e</span> (where <span class="math inline">e</span> is a decimal between 0 and 1) such that
<span class="math inline">(1 - e) \cdot \frac{100 + p}{100} = 1</span>.
Solving for <span class="math inline">e</span> gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*} (1 - e) \cdot \frac{100 +
p}{100} &amp;= 1 \\ 1 - e &amp;= \frac{100}{100 + p} \\ e &amp;= 1 -
\frac{100}{100 + p} \\ e &amp;= \frac{100 + p}{100 + p} - \frac{100}{100
+ p} \\ e &amp;= \frac{p}{100 + p} \end{align*}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p}</span> is a decimal
between 0 and 1, so to convert it to a percentage we can multiply it by
<span class="math inline">100\%</span>. To conclude, if a store sells an
item for <span class="math inline">p</span>% more than its true value,
<span class="math inline">t</span>, then they must offer employees a
discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{p}{100 + p} \cdot
100\%</span> in order for their post-discount price to be equal to <span class="math inline">t</span>.</p>
<p>This is a scary looking formula, but let’s try it in action: if we
let <span class="math inline">p</span> be 25, as it was in the first
part of this question, we then have a discount of <span class="math inline">\frac{25}{100 + 25} \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">0.2 \cdot 100\%</span>, or <span class="math inline">20\%</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: 30 minutes</p>
<p>To actually solve this problem requires a bit of math, but it turns
out we can narrow it down to the correct answer using the process of
elimination and some common sense. First of all, some of these answers
are tempting because they come naturally from the numbers given in the
problem. For example, 125 minutes is the sum of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. Likewise, 62.5 minutes is the average of 50 minutes and 75
minutes. But does it make sense to sum or average the times? No! Think
of it this way: there is a fixed amount of work to be done (grade 150
quizzes). Working alone, the professor can knock out that task in 50
minutes. With help, the professor will finish the task even faster. So
the answer must be less than 50 minutes.</p>
<p>That leaves two options: 25 minutes and 30 minutes. Notice that 25
minutes is half the time it would take for the professor to grade the
quizzes alone. If the professor were able to clone themself, then the
two professors could grade the quizzes in 25 minutes, working double the
speed of one professor. But the TA is not quite as fast as a second
professor. So it will take more than 25 minutes for one professor and
one TA to complete the grading. This leaves only one answer that can
make sense, so the answer must be 30 minutes. We can solve the problem
without doing any math!</p>
<p>It’s always good to double-check that our answer is correct. Let’s
actually solve this problem using math now. To start, we know that the
professor grades at a rate of 150 quizzes per 50 minutes, which is 3
quizzes per minute because <span class="math inline">\frac{150}{50} =
\frac{3}{1}</span>. The TA grades 150 quizzes per 75 minutes, or 2
quizzes per minute. This means that in one minute, the professor can
grade 3 quizzes and the TA can grade 2 quizzes, for a total of 5
quizzes.</p>
<p>When working together, the professor and TA grade at a rate of 5
quizzes per minute. So how much time do they need to grade 150 quizzes?
5 quizzes per minute is equivalent to 150 quizzes per 30 minutes, since
<span class="math inline">\frac{5}{1} = \frac{150}{30}</span>.
Therefore, it takes them 30 minutes to complete their grading task, as
we obtained through process of elimination.</p>

<p>You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below,
because both of them would fail to win you the prize. All we know is
that at least one of the candies has to be yellow, blue, or green. They
might all be those colors, or they might not.

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>All five M&amp;M’s were one of the following colors: red, orange,
brown. <strong>Cannot be true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If all five candies were red, orange, or brown, such as in the
picture below, you would have actually won the prize. Since you didn’t
win the prize, that tells us this can’t be true.
</p>
<center><img src="../assets/images/pretest/candy5.jpg" width="50%"/></center>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>One or more M&amp;M’s was yellow, blue, or green. <strong>Must be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This has to be true, because if it were not true, you would have won
the prize. The opposite of “one or more” is “none” and the condition to
win the prize was that none of your candies could be yellow, blue, or
green.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>One or more M&amp;M’s was red, orange, or brown. <strong>May be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It could be the case that you had a red, orange, or brown candy among
your five, as in the first picture below. But you may have also not had
any red, orange, or browns, like in the second picture below. For both
groups of candies shown below, you would have failed to win the prize.

<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>None of the M&amp;M’s were yellow, blue, or green. <strong>Cannot be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is exactly the winning condition, but we know you did not win
the prize, so this cannot be true.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>None of the M&amp;M’s were red, orange, or brown. <strong>May be
true.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You failed to win the prize because you had at least one candy that
was yellow, blue, or green. You may have had some red, orange, or brown
candies included among your five, or you may not have. Either of the two
groups of five below is possible, because you would not have won the
prize either way.
