<p>DSC 10’s only prerequisite is high school algebra. In order to gauge
your preparedness for the type of math you’ll see in this class, you
should work through the following practice problems on your own. You
will not submit it, and it will not be graded, but it will help you
identify any gaps in your background knowledge and it will teach you
some useful test-taking skills. Solutions will be posted here on
Wednesday, April 3.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>
<!-- <topics>arithmetic, fractions</topics> -->
<p>Express <span class="math inline">\frac{42}{9} \cdot
\frac{36}{21}</span> as an integer without using a calculator and
without long division or multiplication.</p>
<!-- Then we can cancel a 7 and two 3s to get $2\cdot2\cdot2 = 8$. 

We can also do this one bit at a time by noticing common factors in the numerator and denominator. For example, we might simplify this as
$$\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} = \frac{42}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{21} = \frac{6}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 8.$$ -->

<p>You plan to drive to campus for your Monday, Wednesday, Friday
classes and you are interested in knowing how many parking spaces are
available in each of three parking structures (Gilman, Hopkins, and
Pangea). We’ll assume for this problem that these are the only three
parking options available. The table below shows how many unoccupied
spaces there are in each parking structure at 10am on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday of Week 1.</p>

<p>On Monday, the percentage of occupied spaces in Pangea is twice the
percentage of occupied spaces in Hopkins. If Pangea has 950 parking
spaces, how many parking spaces does Hopkins have? You may use a
calculator for this part.</p>

<h2 id="problem-7">Problem 7</h2>
<p>Every year, San Diego’s Regional Task Force on Homelessness conducts
a “point-in-time” count of the number of homeless individuals in San
Diego County. They send out a team of over a thousand volunteers to
locate and count homeless individuals throughout the county’s shelters,
streets, encampments, cars, etc. In 2023, newspapers reported that the
count increased by 22% from the 2022 count. Part of that increase was
explained by the fact that for the first time, volunteers were able to
access and count people on Caltrans property. It was also reported that
if we were to exclude the people who were counted on Caltrans property,
the count would have still increased by 14%, meaning that the additional
area covered could not explain all of the increase from one year’s count
to the next. The 2023 point-in-time count was 10,264 individuals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-7.1">Problem 7.1</h3>
<p>The point-in-time count is an underestimate of the true number of
homeless individuals in San Diego County. Why is it always an
underestimate?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-7.2">Problem 7.2</h3>
<p>How many individuals in 2023 were counted on Caltrans property? You
may use a calculator.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-7.3">Problem 7.3</h3>
<p>The actual number of individuals counted on Caltrans property in 2023
was 661, which should be close to your answer to the previous question,
but not exactly the same. Did the newspapers make a mistake or is there
another explanation for the discrepancy?</p>

<p>At a furniture store, suppose every item has a “true value” that
represents its worth. Every item in the store has a ticketed price,
which is the amount that is printed on the item’s price tag that
customers will pay, that is 25% higher its true value. The store wants
its employees to be able to buy items at their true value. What percent
discount does it need to give its employees off the ticketed price to
accomplish this?</p>
<p>In general, if a store marks up prices by <span
class="math inline">p</span>%, what percent discount does it need to
give to employees off the ticketed price so that they can buy things at
the true value?</p>

<p>One of your classes this quarter, PTS 1: <em>Principles of Taylor
Swift</em>, has the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>20% Midterm 1</li>
<li>20% Midterm 2</li>
<li>30% Homeworks (lowest homework dropped)</li>
<li>30% Final Exam</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 homework assignments, but your lowest homework score is
dropped from your overall grade calculation. Each homework assignment is
worth the same amount in your overall grade calculation, even though
they have different numbers of available points. Your scores on all
parts of the course, before the Final Exam, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: <span class="math inline">\frac{98}{100}</span></li>
<li>Midterm 2: <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{38}</span></li>
<li>Homework 1: <span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4}</span></li>
<li>Homework 2: <span class="math inline">\frac{18}{25}</span></li>
<li>Homework 3: <span class="math inline">\frac{9}{10}</span></li>
<li>Homework 4: <span class="math inline">\frac{12}{13}</span></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the minimum possible score you can earn on the Final Exam,
<strong>as a percentage</strong>, to guarantee that you finish with at
least a B grade (80% overall) in PTS 1? You may use a calculator (tip:
you can type arithmetic expressions into Google and it will perform
calculations for you!).</p>

<p>There are six different colors of M&amp;M candies: yellow, blue,
green, red, orange, and brown. You and your friend are playing a game.
You will pick five M&amp;Ms from a bag with your eyes closed. Your
friend will give you a prize if none of the candies you picked are
yellow, green, or blue. Unfortunately, when you play this game, you
don’t win the prize. What does this say about the candies you chose? For
each statement below, say whether the statement <strong>must be
true</strong>, <strong>may be true</strong>, or <strong>cannot be
true</strong>.</p>
