title: 'Pretest'
context: >
  This pretest will not be submitted, and it will not be graded, but it will help you identify any gaps in your background knowledge and it will teach you some useful test-taking skills. We’ll release solutions to the pretest on Wednesday of Week 1.

  <!--This pretest is due **Thursday, April 3rd at 11:59PM**, or at 11:59PM the day after you join the class, whichever is later. Write your solutions on paper, and show your work, then submit to Gradescope. 
  <br><br>The pretest will be graded based on honest effort, not on the correctness of your responses. You will earn participation credit for completing the pretest to the best of your ability. We’ll release solutions to the pretest at the beginning of Week 2. You are highly encouraged to check how you did and learn from the solutions. -->
