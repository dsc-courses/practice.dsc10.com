title: 'Discussion 2: Python Basics, Arrays, and DataFrames'
context: >
  Welcome to Discussion 2 in Spring 2023! Note that the problems on this page may change between now and the day of Discussion 2 (April 12th), but we've uploaded them early so that you can see how discussions will generally work.<br><br>
  The problems in this worksheet are taken from past exams. Work on them **on paper**, since the exams you take in this course will also be on paper. 
  <br><br>We encourage you to complete this worksheet in a live discussion section. 
  Solutions will be made available after all discussion sections have concluded. You don't need to submit your answers anywhere. <br><br><b>Note: We do not plan to cover all problems here in the live discussion section</b>; the problems we don't cover can be used for extra practice.
