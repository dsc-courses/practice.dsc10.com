title: 'Discussion 4: Functions, DataFrames, Control Flow, Probability, and Simulation'
context: >
  The problems in this worksheet are taken from past exams. Work on them **on paper**, since the exams you take in this course will also be on paper. 
  <br><br>We encourage you to complete this worksheet in a live discussion section. 
  Solutions will be made available after all discussion sections have concluded. You don't need to submit your answers anywhere.<br><br><b>Note: We do not plan to cover all problems here in the live discussion section</b>; the problems we don't cover can be used for extra practice.
