context: >
  Welcome! The problems shown below should be worked on **on paper**, since the quizzes and exams you take in this course will also be on paper. You do not need to submit your solutions anywhere.
  <br><br>We encourage you to complete this worksheet in groups during an extra practice session on Friday, January 26. Solutions will be posted after all sessions have finished. This problem set is not designed to take any particular amount of time - focus on understanding concepts, not on getting through all the questions.
