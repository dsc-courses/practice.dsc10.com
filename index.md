<h1><a href=''>üí™ Practice Problems</a></h1>

<h3><a href='https://dsc10.com'>DSC 10 at UC San Diego</a></h3>

---

This site contains practice problems taken from old DSC 10 exams. We've organized problems in two ways:

1. As **discussions**. Each discussion page contains problems about a particular topic. Come to in-person discussion sections to work on discussion problems with the help of our course staff.
1. As **practice exams**. Work through these in the weeks leading up to exams.

In all cases, you should work on these problems **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.
<!-- 
**Tip:** Keep the [DSC 10 Reference Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ky0Np67HS2O4LO913P-ing97SJG0j27n/view) open in another tab. **You will have access to the Reference Sheet during exams (but no other resources).** -->
