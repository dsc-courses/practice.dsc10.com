<h1><a href=''>Practice Problems</a></h1>

<h3><a href='https://dsc10.com'>DSC 10, Fall 2022</a></h3>

---

This site contains practice problems taken from old DSC 10 exams. We've organized problems in two ways:

1. As **discussions**. Each discussion page contains problems about a particular topic. Come to in-person discussion sections to work on discussion problems with the help of our course staff.
1. As **practice exams**. Work through these in the weeks leading up to exams.

In all cases, you should work on these problems **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.

**Tip:** Keep the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQApk9Ovdi-QVqMgnNcq5dZcWucUKoG-/view?usp=sharing'>DSC 10 Reference Sheet<a> open in another tab. **You will have access to the Reference Sheet during exams (but no other resources).**

### Discussions

Solutions to discussion worksheets will be made available on Monday evenings, after all live discussion sections have concluded.

### Exams

Each exam linked here lists the conditions under which the exam was given, including the allotted amount of time and the resources allowed. For the best preparation, work through all the questions on an exam in order under these same conditions, writing down your answers on paper as you go, then check all your answers at the end.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">New! We've started to embed <i>difficulty meters</i> in the solutions of exam questions, like this one. 

<center><div id="myDiv-example"></div></center>
<script type="text/javascript">
var data = [
{
    domain: { x: [0, 1], y: [0, 1] },
    value: 35,
    title: { text: "Difficulty"},
    type: "indicator",
    mode: "gauge+number",
    gauge: {
        axis: {
            range: [0, 100]
        },
        bar: {
            color: "gold"
        }
    }
}
];

var layout = { width: 300, 
            height: 200, 
            margin: { t: 0, b: 0 }, 
            font: {family: "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"},
            annotations: [{x: 0.5, y: 0.18, xref: 'paper', yref: 'paper', text: "The average score on this problem was 65%.", showarrow: false}],
            plot_bgcolor:"#d0e2ff",
            paper_bgcolor:"#d0e2ff"};
Plotly.newPlot('myDiv-example', data, layout, {displayModeBar: false});
</script>

The difficulty of a problem is $100 - \text{average score on the problem}$. Difficulty is a little subjective, as different groups of students perform differently on exams. With that said, the difficulty meters should help you gauge your preparedness for upcoming exams.</div>
