<h1><a href=''>Practice Problems</a></h1>

<h3><a href='https://dsc10.com'>DSC 10, Spring 2023</a></h3>

---

This site contains practice problems taken from old DSC 10 exams. We've organized problems in two ways:

1. As **discussions**. Each discussion page contains problems about a particular topic. Come to in-person discussion sections to work on discussion problems with the help of our course staff.
1. As **practice exams**. Work through these in the weeks leading up to exams.

In all cases, you should work on these problems **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.

**Tip:** Keep the [DSC 10 Reference Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ky0Np67HS2O4LO913P-ing97SJG0j27n/view) open in another tab. **You will have access to the Reference Sheet during exams (but no other resources).**

<!-- <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><b>New</b>: In the solutions of most problems, you'll see a difficulty rating between 1 and 5 stars (‚≠êÔ∏è being the easiest and ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è being the hardest). These ratings depend on the proportion of students that answered the problem correctly when it appeared in an exam. Measuring difficulty by student performance does not take into account the fact that different groups of students will perform differently on exams. With that said, the difficulty ratings should still help you gauge your preparedness for upcoming exams.</div> -->

### Exams

Each exam linked here lists the conditions under which the exam was given, including the allotted amount of time and the resources allowed. For the best preparation, work through all the questions on an exam in order under these same conditions, writing down your answers on paper as you go, then check all your answers at the end.
