### About

This site contains practice problems taken from old exams. You should work on these questions **on paper**, since your exams will also be on paper. 

Each exam linked here lists the conditions under which the exam was given, including the allotted amount of time and the resources allowed. For the best preparation, work through all the questions on an exam in order under these same conditions, writing down your answers on paper as you go, then check all your answers at the end.

**Tip:** Keep the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQApk9Ovdi-QVqMgnNcq5dZcWucUKoG-/view?usp=sharing'>DSC 10 Reference Sheet<a> open in another tab.
