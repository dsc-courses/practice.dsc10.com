# practice.dsc10.com

Repository containing practice problems for DSC 10 (past exams and discussion). Hosted at practice.dsc10.com.

Style guide for writing up problems:

- **Answer:** should be bolded followed by unbolded answer(s), comma separated if it fits on one line, or each answer on a new line if it doesn't fit on one line
- Use () for choose one, [] for select all. Add a space before the text of each answer choice.
- For subsubparts, use numbers followed by period to introduce each question

In translating from Latex to Markdown, there are a few easy find/replace things that help with a lot of things:

\begin{verbatim} --> ```py
\end{verbatim} --> ```
" --> '
\_ --> _
\texttt{ --> `
\textbf{ --> **
\textit{ --> *
\bubble --> ()
\correctbubble --> ()
\squarebubble --> []
\correctsquarebubble --> []
