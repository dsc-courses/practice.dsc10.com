In this exam, you’ll work with a data set showcasing the different dining halls at UCSD and
the foods served there. Each row represents a single menu item available at one of the UCSD
dining halls.
The columns of `dining` are as follows:

• `"Dining Hall"` (`str`): The name of the dining hall.

• `"Item"` (`str`): The name of the menu item.

• `"Price"` (`str`): The cost of the menu item.

• `"Calories"` (`int`): The number of calories in the menu item.

The rows of `dining` are in no particular order. The first few rows are shown below, though
`dining` has many more rows than pictured.
