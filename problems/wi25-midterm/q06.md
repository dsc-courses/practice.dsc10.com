# BEGIN PROB

At OceanView Terrace, you can make a custom pizza. There
are 6 toppings available. Suppose you include each topping with a
probability of 0.5, independently of all other toppings.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability you create a pizza with no toppings at all? Give
your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 1/64

<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that you create a pizza with exactly three
toppings? Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `toppa` evaluates
to an estimate of this probability.

```py
        tiptop = 0
        num_trials = 10000
        
        for i in np.arange(num_trials):
            pizza = np.random.choice([0,1], __(a)__)
            if np.__(b)__ == 3:
                tiptop = __(c)__

        toppa = __(d)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `6`

<average>58</average>

**Answer (b):** `count nonzero(pizza) or sum(pizza)`

<average>58</average>

**Answer (c):** `tiptop + 1`

<average>81</average>

**Answer (d):** `tiptop / num_trials`

<average>84</average>

What is the meaning of `tiptop` after the code has finished running?

( ) The number of repetitions in our simulation.
( ) The size of our sample.
( ) The number of times we randomly selected three toppings.
( ) The proportion of times we randomly selected three toppings.
( ) The number of toppings we randomly selected.
( ) None of these answers is what `tiptop` represents.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The number of times we randomly selected three toppings. 

<average>77</average>
