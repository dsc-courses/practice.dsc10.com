At OceanView Terrace, you can make a custom pizza. There
are 6 toppings available. Suppose you include each topping with a
probability of 0.5, independently of all other toppings.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability you create a pizza with no toppings at all? Give
your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 1/64

We want the probability that we create a pizza with no toppings at all, which is to say **$0$** toppings. The problem statement gives us two important pieces of information that we use to calculate this probability:

1. The probability of including every topping is independent of every other topping.
   The independence of including different toppings means that the probability that we create a pizza with **$0$** toppings can be framed as a sequence of independent events, or a product of probabilities:
   $P(Not topping 1) \cdot P(Not topping 2) \cdot ... \cdot P(Not topping 6)$.
2. The probability of including a topping is **$0.5$**
   This means that the probability of not including some topping t, or the complement of including the topping, is $1 - P(including topping t) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.
   So, the probability of creating a pizza with no toppings is $0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5^6$

What is the probability that you create a pizza with exactly three
toppings? Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `toppa` evaluates
to an estimate of this probability.

```py
        tiptop = 0
        num_trials = 10000

        for i in np.arange(num_trials):
            pizza = np.random.choice([0,1], __(a)__)
            if np.__(b)__ == 3:
                tiptop = __(c)__

        toppa = __(d)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `6`

Blank(a) is the $size$ parameter of `np.random.choice`. To determine what value belongs here, consider the context of the code:
We are defining a variable `pizza`, representing one simulated pizza. Consider what that means in the context of this simulation; as we are trying to estimate the probability of including exactly three toppings on a pizza, we can simulate the creation of one pizza by deciding whether to include each of the 6 toppings.
Further, we have instructed `np.random.choice` to select from the array $[0, 1]$. These are the possible outcomes, and will be randomly drawn from $size$ times. In the context of this problem, these outcomes represent whether we include a topping. So, we must randomly choose between them $6$ times, once per topping. Keep in mind that by default, `replace=True`, enabling us to draw multiple 0's or 1's.
So, what goes in blank(a) is $6$.

**Answer (b):** `count_nonzero(pizza) or sum(pizza)`

`pizza` is an array of 0's and 1's, representing if we included a topping ($1$) or not ($0$) for each of the 6 toppings. At this step, we want to check if we have three toppings, or if there are exactly three 1's in our array. We can either do this by finding the sum of this array using `np.sum(pizza)` (because the sum is the total number of 1's), or by counting how many non-zero elements occur (using `np.count_nonzero(pizza)`).

<average>58</average>

**Answer (c):** `tiptop + 1`

`tiptop` is a counter representing the number times we had exactly three toppings in our simulation. We want to add 1 to it every time we have exactly three different toppings, or when we satisfy the above condition (`np.count_nonzero(pizza) == 3`). This is important so that by the end of the simulation, we have a total count of the number of times we had exactly three toppings, and we .

**Answer (d):** `tiptop / num_trials`

`tiptop` is the number times we had exactly three toppings in our simulation. To convert this count into a proportion, we need to divide it by the total number of trials in our simluation, or `num_trials`.

What is the meaning of `tiptop` after the code has finished running?

( ) The number of repetitions in our simulation.
( ) The size of our sample.
( ) The number of times we randomly selected three toppings.
( ) The proportion of times we randomly selected three toppings.
( ) The number of toppings we randomly selected.
( ) None of these answers is what `tiptop` represents.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The number of times we randomly selected three toppings.

1 is added to `tiptop` every time the condition `np.count_nonzero(pizza) == 3` is satisfied. This means that `tiptop` contains the total number of times in our simulation where `np.count_nonzero(pizza) == 3`, or where our pizza contained exactly three toppings.
