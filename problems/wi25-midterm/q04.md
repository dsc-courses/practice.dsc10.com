Fill in the blanks to define a variable `bins` that could have been used
as the `bins` argument in the call to `.plot` that generated the
histogram above.

```py
    bins = 0.5 * (2 + np.arange(__(a)__, __(b)__, __(c)__))
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `8`

The first piece of information to note is what the bins are in the original histogram; if we know where we need to arrive at the end of the problem, it is much easier to piece together the arguments we need to pass to `np.arange` in the code provided.

With this in mind, the bins in the original histogram are defined by the array with values `[5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]`. So, we can work backwards from here to answer this question.

The final step in the code is multiplying the result of `2 + np.arange(a, b, c)` by `0.5`. Since we know this must result in `[5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]`, the array generated by `2 + np.arange(a, b, c)` must have the values `[10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34]`.

Using similar logic, we know that `2 + np.arange(a, b, c)` must give us the array with values `[10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34]`. By subtracting two, we get that `np.arange(a, b, c)` must have values `[8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]`.

There are multiple calls to `np.arange()` that result in this sequence. We should start at `8` and step by `4`, but where we stop can be any number larger than `32`, and at most `36`, as this argument is exclusive and not included in the output array. So, the answers are (a) = `8`, (b) = any number larger than `32` and less than or equal to `36`,  and (c) = `4`.

**Answer (b):** any number in the interval `(33, 36]`

What proportion of orders took at least $7$ minutes but less than $12$
minutes to complete?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.3 or 30% 


In a density histogram, the proportion of data in a bar or set of bars is equal to the *area* of those bars. So, to find the proportion of orders that took between $7$ and $12$ minutes to complete, we must find the area of the bars that encapsulate this range.

The bars associated with the bins $[7, 9)$ and $[9, 11)$ contain all of the orders that took between $7$ and $12$ minutes. So, summing the areas of these bars tells us the proportion of orders that took between $7$ and $12$ minutes.

The width of each bar is $2$, and the heights of the bars are $0.05$ and $0.1$, respectively. So, the sum of their areas is
$$2 \cdot 0.05 + 2 \cdot 0.1 = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3.$$
So, $0.30$ or $30\%$ of our orders took between $7$ and $12$ minutes to complete.

<average>82</average>

After some investigation, HDH discovers that every order that took
longer than $12$ minutes to complete was ordered from The Bistro. As a
result, they fire all the employees at The Bistro and permanently close
the dining hall. With this update, we generate a new density histogram
displaying the distribution of wait times for orders from the other UCSD
dining halls.

What are the values of X and Y along the $y$-axis of this histogram?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $X = 0.1$, $Y = 0.2$

The original histogram, including The Bistro's data, showed a cumulative density of `0.5` for the first three bars covering wait times from 5 to 11 minutes. The densities were calculated as:

  - $2 \times 0.1$ (for 5-7 minutes)
  - $2 \times 0.05$ (for 7-9 minutes)
  - $2 \times 0.1$ (for 9-11 minutes)
  - **Total = 0.5**

After we removed The Bistro's data, these wait time intervals (5 to 11 minutes) now account for the entirety of the dataset. Hence, to reflect the new total (100% of the data), the original bar heights need to be doubled, as they previously summed up to `0.5` (or 50% of the data).

  - New height for $5-7$ minutes: $0.2$ (from $0.1$)
  - New height for $7-9$ minutes: $0.1$ (from $0.05$)
  - New height for $9-11$ minutes: $0.2$ (from $0.1$)
  
Thus, the new calculation for total density is: $2 \times 0.2 + 2 \times 0.1 + 2 \times 0.2 = 1.0.$
