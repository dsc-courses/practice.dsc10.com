wait times for orders from UCSD dining halls.

Fill in the blanks to define a variable `bins` that could have been used
as the `bins` argument in the call to `.plot` that generated the
histogram above.

```py
    bins = 0.5 * (2 + np.arange(__(a)__, __(b)__, __(c)__))
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `8`

<average>68</average>

**Answer (b):** anything > 32 and <= 36, such as `33`

<average>56</average>

**Answer (c):** `4`

<average>36</average>

What proportion of orders took at least $7$ minutes but less than $12$
minutes to complete?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.3 or 30% 

<average>82</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

After some investigation, HDH discovers that every order that took
longer than $12$ minutes to complete was ordered from The Bistro. As a
result, they fire all the employees at The Bistro and permanently close
the dining hall. With this update, we generate a new density histogram
displaying the distribution of wait times for orders from the other UCSD
dining halls.
