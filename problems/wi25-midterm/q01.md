# BEGIN PROB

Which of the following columns would be an appropriate index for the
`dining` DataFrame?

( ) `"Dining Hall"`
( ) `"Item"`
( ) `"Price"`
( ) `"Calories"`
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** None of these

None of the following columns would be an appropriate index since they all possibly contain duplicates. We are told that each row represents a single menu item available at one of the UCSD
dining halls. This means that each row represents a combination of both `"Dining Hall"` and `"Item"` so no one column is sufficient to uniquely identify a row. We can see this in the preview of the first few rows of the DataFrame. There are multiple rows with the same value in the `"Dining Hall"` column, and also multiple rows with the same value in the `"Item"` column. 

While `"Price"` and `"Calories"` *could* be unique, it doesn't make sense to refer to a row by its price or number of calories. Further, we have no information that guarantees the values in these columns are unique (they're probably not).
