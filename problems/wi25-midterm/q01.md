# BEGIN PROB

Which of the following columns would be an appropriate index for the
`dining` DataFrame?

( ) `"Dining Hall"`
( ) `"Item"`
( ) `"Price"`
( ) `"Calories"`
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** None of these

None of the following columns would be an appropriate index since they all possibly contain duplicates. Even if `"Price"` and `"Calories"` had all unique values, they aren't things people would use to search by. An index should be something that makes locating something easier, I mean, do you really want to remember the individual price or calories for each menu item?

<average>76</average>
