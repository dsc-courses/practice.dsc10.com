# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we have access to another DataFrame called `orders`, containing
all student dining hall orders from the past three years. `orders`
includes the following columns, among others:

1.  `"Dining Hall"` (`str`): The dining hall where the order was placed.

2.  `"Start"` (`str`): The time the order was placed.

3.  `"End"` (`str`): The time the order was completed.

All times are expressed in 24-hour military time format (HH:MM). For
example, `"13:15"` indicates 1:15 PM. All orders were completed on the
same day as they were placed, and `"End"` is always after `"Start"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `to_minutes` below. The function
takes in a string representing a time in 24-hour military time format
(HH:MM) and returns an int representing the number of minutes that have
elapsed since midnight. Example behavior is given below.

```py
    >>> to_minutes("02:35")
    155

    >>> to_minutes("13:15")
    795

    def to_minutes(time):
        separate = time.__(a)__
        hour = __(b)__
        minute = __(c)__
        return __(d)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `split(":")`

We first want to separate the time string into hours and minutes, so we use `split(":")` to turn a string like `"HH:MM"` into a list of the form `["HH", "MM"]`.

<average>84</average>

**Answer (b):** `separate[0]` or `int(separate[0])`

The hour will be the first element of the split list, so we can access it using `separate[0]`. This is a string, which we can convert to an `int` now, or later in blank (d).

<average>73</average>

**Answer (c):** `separate[1]` or `int(separate[1])`

The minute will be the second element of the split list, so we can access it using `separate[1]` or `separate[-1]`. Likewise, this is also a string, which we can convert to an `int` now, or later in blank (d).


<average>73</average>

**Answer (d):** `int(hour) * 60 + int(minute)` or `hour * 60 + minute` (depending on the answers to (b) and (c))

In order to convert hours and minutes into minutes since midnight, we have to multiply the hours by 60 and add the number of minutes. These operations must be done with `int`s, not strings.

<average>73</average>

Fill in the blanks below to add a new column called `"Wait"` to
`orders`, which contains the number of minutes elapsed between when an
order is placed and when it is completed. Note that the first two blanks
both say `(e)` because they should be filled in with the same value.

```py
    start_min = orders.get("Start").__(e)__
    end_min = orders.get("End").__(e)__
    orders = orders.assign(Wait = __(f)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (e):** `apply(to_minutes)`

In order to find the time between when an order is placed and completed, we first need to convert the `"Start"` and `"End"` times to minutes since midnight, so that we can subtract them. We apply the function we wrote in Problem 3.1 to get the values of `"Start"` and `"End"` in minutes elapsed since midnight.

<average>87</average>

**Answer (f):** `end_min - start_min`

Now that we have the values of `"Start"` and `"End"` columns in minutes, we simply need to subtract them to find the wait time. Note that we are subtracting two Series here, so the subtraction happens element-wise by matching up corresponding elements.

<average>87</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

You were told that `"End"` is always after `"Start"` in `orders`, but
you want to verify if this is correct. Fill the blank below so that the
result is `True` if `"End"` is indeed always after `"Start"`, and
`False` otherwise.

```py
    (orders.get("Wait") > 0).sum() == __(g)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (g):** `orders.shape[0]`

Since `"Wait"` was already calculated in the previous question by subtracting `"End"` minus `"Start"`, we know that positive values indicate where `"End"` is after `"Start"`. When we evaluate `orders.get("Wait") = 0`, we get a Boolean Series where `True` indicates rows where `"End"` is after `"Start"`. Taking the `.sum()` of this Boolean Series counts how many rows satisfy this condition, using the fact that `True` is `1` and `False` is `0` in Python. If `"End"` is always after `"Start"`, this sum should equal the total number of rows in the DataFrame, which is `orders.shape[0]`. Therefore, comparing the sum to `orders.shape[0]` will return `True` exactly when `"End"` is after `"Start"` for all rows.

<average>36</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that `ranked` evaluates to an array
containing the names of the dining halls in `orders`, sorted in
descending order by **average wait time**.

```py
    ranked = np.array(orders.__(h)__
                             .sort_values(by="Wait", ascending=False)
                             .__(i)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (h):** `groupby('Dining Hall').mean()`

Since we want to compare the average wait time for each Dining Hall we know we need to aggregate each Dining Hall and find the mean of the `"Wait"` column. This can be done using `groupby('Dining Hall').mean()`.

<average>62</average>

**Answer (i):** `index` or `reset_index().get('Dining Hall')`

The desired output is an array with the **names** of each dining hall. After grouping and sorting, the dining hall names become the index of our DataFrame. Since we want an array of these names in descending order of wait times, we can either use `.index` to get them directly, or `reset_index().get("Dining Hall")` to convert the index back to a column and select it.

<average>43</average>

What would be the most appropriate type of data visualization to compare
dining halls by average wait time?

( ) scatter plot
( ) line plot
( ) bar chart
( ) histogram
( ) overlaid plot

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** bar chart

`"Dining Hall"` is a categorical variable and the average wait time is a numerical variable, so a bar chart should be used. Our visualization would have a bar for each dining hall, and the length of that bar would be proportional to the average wait time.
