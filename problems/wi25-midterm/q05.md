It's the grand opening of UCSD's newest dining attraction: The Bread
Basket! As a hardcore bread enthusiast, you celebrate by eating as much
bread as possible. There are only a few menu items at The Bread Basket,
shown with their costs in the table below:

    **Bread**    **Cost**
  ------------- ----------
    Sourdough       2
   Whole Wheat      3
   Multigrain       4

Suppose you are given an array `eaten` containing the names of each type
of bread you ate.

For example, `eaten` could be defined as follows:

```py
    eaten = np.array(["Whole Wheat", "Sourdough", "Whole Wheat", 
                      "Sourdough", "Sourdough"])
```

In this example, `eaten` represents five slices of bread that you ate,
for a total cost of $\$12$. Pricey!

In this problem, you'll calculate the total cost of your bread-eating
extravaganza in various ways. In all cases, your code must calculate the
total cost for an arbitrary `eaten` array, which might not be exactly
the same as the example shown above.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

One way to calculate the total cost of the bread in the `eaten`
array is outlined below. Fill in the missing code.

```py
    breads = ["Sourdough", "Whole Wheat", "Multigrain"]
    prices = [2, 3, 4]
    total_cost = 0
    for i in __(a)__:
        total_cost = (total_cost + 
                     np.count_nonzero(eaten == __(b)__) * __(c)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `[0, 1, 2]` or `np.arange(len(bread))` or `range(3)` or equivalent

<average>58</average>

**Answer (b):** `breads[i]`

<average>61</average>

**Answer (c):** `prices[i]`

<average>61</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A third way to calculate the total cost of the bread in the `eaten`
array uses the `merge` method. Fill in the missing code below.

```py
    available = bpd.DataFrame().assign(Type = ["Sourdough", 
                "Whole Wheat", "Multigrain"]).assign(Cost = [2, 3, 4])
    consumed = bpd.DataFrame().assign(Eaten = eaten)
    combined = available.merge(consumed, left_on = __(d)__, 
                               right_on = __(e)__)   
    total_cost = combined.__(f)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (d):** `'Type'`

<average>81</average>

**Answer (e):** `'Eaten'`

<average>80</average>

**Answer (f):** `get('Cost').sum()`

<average>70</average>
