It's the grand opening of UCSD's newest dining attraction: The Bread
Basket! As a hardcore bread enthusiast, you celebrate by eating as much
bread as possible. There are only a few menu items at The Bread Basket,
shown with their costs in the table below:

    **Bread**    **Cost**
  ------------- ----------
    Sourdough       2
   Whole Wheat      3
   Multigrain       4

Suppose you are given an array `eaten` containing the names of each type
of bread you ate.

For example, `eaten` could be defined as follows:

```py
    eaten = np.array(["Whole Wheat", "Sourdough", "Whole Wheat", 
                      "Sourdough", "Sourdough"])
```

In this example, `eaten` represents five slices of bread that you ate,
for a total cost of $\$12$. Pricey!

In this problem, you'll calculate the total cost of your bread-eating
extravaganza in various ways. In all cases, your code must calculate the
total cost for an arbitrary `eaten` array, which might not be exactly
the same as the example shown above.

One way to calculate the total cost of the bread in the `eaten`
array is outlined below. Fill in the missing code.

```py
    breads = ["Sourdough", "Whole Wheat", "Multigrain"]
    prices = [2, 3, 4]
    total_cost = 0
    for i in __(a)__:
        total_cost = (total_cost + 
                     np.count_nonzero(eaten == __(b)__) * __(c)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `[0, 1, 2]` or `np.arange(len(bread))` or `range(3)` or equivalent

Let's read through the code skeleton and develop the answers from intuition. First, we notice a `for` loop, but we don't yet know what sequence we'll be looping through.

Then we notice a variable `total_cost` that is initalized to `0`. This suggests we'll use the accumulator pattern to keep a running total. 

Inside the loop, we see that we are indeed adding onto the running total. The amount by which we increase `total_cost` is `np.count_nonzero(eaten == __(b)__) * __(c)__`. Let's remember what this does. It first compares the `eaten` array to some value and then counts how many `True` values are in resulting Boolean array. In other words, it counts how many times the entries in the `eaten` array equal some particular value. This is a big clue about how to fill in the code. There are only three possible values in the `eaten` array, and they are `"Sourdough"`, `"Whole Wheat"`, and `"Multigrain"`. For example, if blank (b) were filled with `"Sourdough"`, we would be counting how many of the slices in the `eaten` array were `"Sourdough"`. Since each such slice costs 2 dollars, we could find the total cost of all `"Sourdough"` slices by multiplying this count by 2. 

Understanding this helps us understand what the code is doing: it is separately computing the cost of each type of bread (`"Sourdough"`, `"Whole Wheat"`, `"Multigrain"`) and adding this onto the running total. Once we understand what the code is doing, we can figure out how to fill in the blanks.

We just discussed filling in blank (b) with `"Sourdough"`, in which case we would have to fill in blank (c) with `2`. But that just gives the contribution of `"Sourdough"` to the overall cost. We also need the contributions from `"Whole Wheat"` and `"Multigrain"`. Somehow, blank (b) needs to take on the values in the provided `breads` array. Similarly, blank (c) needs to take on the values in the `prices` array, and we need to make sure that we iterate through both of these arrays simultaneously. This means we should access `breads[0]` when we access `prices[0]`, for example. We can use the loop variable `i` to help us, and fill in blank (b) with `breads[i]` and blank (c) with `prices[i]`. This means `i` needs to take on the values `0`, `1`, `2`, so we can loop through the sequence `[0, 1, 2]` in blank (a). This is also the same as `range(len(bread))` and `range(len(price))`. 

Bravo! We have everything we want, and the code block is now complete.

Another way to calculate the total cost of the bread in the `eaten`
array uses the `merge` method. Fill in the missing code below.

```py
    available = bpd.DataFrame().assign(Type = ["Sourdough", 
                "Whole Wheat", "Multigrain"]).assign(Cost = [2, 3, 4])
    consumed = bpd.DataFrame().assign(Eaten = eaten)
    combined = available.merge(consumed, left_on = __(d)__, 
                               right_on = __(e)__)   
    total_cost = combined.__(f)__
```

**Answer (d):** `"Type"`

It always helps to sketch out the DataFrames. 
<center><img src="../assets/images/wi25-midterm/q5-2.png" width=300></center>

Let's first develop some intuition based on the keywords.  

1. We create two DataFrames as seen above, and we perform a [merge](https://dsc-courses.github.io/bpd-reference/docs/documentation/building-organizing/df.merge()) operation. We want to fill in what columns to merge on. It should be easy to see that blank (e) would be the `"Eaten"` column in `consumed`, so let's fill that in.

2. We are getting `total_cost` from the `combined` DataFrame in some way. If we want the total amount of something, which aggregation function might we use? 

In general, if we have `df_left.merge(df_right, left_on=col_left, right_on=col_right)`, assuming all entries are non-empty, the merge process looks at individual entries from the specified column in `df_left` and grabs all entries from the specified column in `df_right` that matches the entry content. Based on this, we know that the `combined` DataFrame will contain a column of all the breads we have eaten and their corresponding prices. Blank (d) is also settled: we can get the list of all breads by merging on the `"Type"` column in `available` to match with `"Eaten"`. 

<average>81</average>

**Answer (e):** `"Eaten"`

See explanation above.

<average>80</average>

**Answer (f):** `get("Cost").sum()`

The `combined` DataFrame would look something like this:
<center><img src="../assets/images/wi25-midterm/q5-2-f.png" width=200></center>

To get the total cost of the bread in `"Eaten"`, we can take the sum of the `"Cost"` column.
