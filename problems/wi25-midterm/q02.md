As a broke college student, you are on a mission to find the dining hall
with the greatest number of affordable menu items.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

To begin, you want a DataFrame with the same columns as `dining`, but
with an additional column `"Affordability"` which classifies each menu
item as follows:

1.  `"Cheap"`, for items that cost \$6 or less.

2.  `"Moderate"`, for items that cost more than \$6 and at most \$14.

3.  `"Expensive"`, for items that cost more than \$14.

Fill in the blanks below to assign this new DataFrame to the variable
`with_affordability`.

```py
    def categorize(price):
        price_as_float = __(a)__  
        if price_as_float __(b)__:
            return __(c)__
        elif price_as_float > 6:
            return "Moderate"
        else:
            return __(d)__
    with_affordability = dining.assign(Affordability = __(e)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `float(price.replace('$', ''))` or `float(price.strip('$'))` or `float(price[1:])` or `float(price.split('$')[1])`

To solve this problem, we must keep in mind that the prices in the `'Price'` column are formatted as strings with dollar signs in front of them. For example, we might see a value such as '\$9.50'. Our function's goal is to transform any given value in the `'Price'` column into a float matching the corresponding dollar amount. Therefore, we can first use the `strip` function to strip the price of the dollar sign. This would look something like `price.strip('$')`. Since we need our output as a float, we can run the python `float` function on this to get the price as a float.

**Answer (b):** `> 14`

The key to getting this question correct comes from understanding how the placement of `price_as_float > 6` affects how you order the rest of the conditionals within the function. The method through which we test if a price is `'Moderate'` is by checking if `price_as_float > 6`. For a price to be `'Expensive'`, it must be greater than 14. However, since every price greater than 14 is also greater than 6, we must check to see if the price is `'Expensive'` before we check and see if the price is `'Moderate'`. Otherwise, all `'Expensive'` prices would just be labeled `'Moderate'` before we could even check if they were `'Expensive'`.

<average>74</average>

**Answer (c):** `'Expensive'`

In the previous part of this question we checked to see if the `price_as_float > 14`. We did this to see if the given price falls into the `'Expensive'` category. Since the `categorize` function is meant to take in a price and output the corresponding category, we just need to output the correct category for this conditional which is `'Expensive'`.

<average>75</average>

**Answer (d):** `'Cheap'`

In the previous parts of this question, we have implemented checks to see if a price is expensive or moderate priced. This leaves only the `'Cheap'` price category, meaning that it can be placed in the else statement. The logic is we check if a price is `'Expensive'` or `'Moderate'` and if its neither, it has to be `'Cheap'`. 

<average>74</average>

**Answer (e):** `dining.get('Price').apply(categorize)`

Now that we have implemented the `categorize` function, we need to apply it to the `'Price'` column so that it can be added as a new column into `dining`. Keep in mind our function takes in one price and outputs it's price category. Thus, we need a way to apply this function to every value in the series. We can do this by using the series method `apply`. To do this, we first need to get the series from the data frame and then use `apply` on that series with our `categorize` function as the input.

Now, you want to determine, for each dining hall, the number of menu
items that fall into each affordability category. Fill in the blanks to
define a DataFrame called `counts` containing this information. `counts`
should have exactly three columns, named `"Dining Hall"`,
`"Affordability"`, and `"Count"`.

```py
    counts = with_affordability.groupby(__(f)__).count().reset_index()
    counts = counts.assign(Count=__(g)__).__(h)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (f):** `['Dining Hall', 'Affordability']` or `['Affordability', 'Dining Hall']`

The key to solving this problem comes from understanding exactly what the question is asking. You are asked to create a dataframe that displays in each dining hall, the number of menu items that fall into each affordability category. This indicates that you will need groups within groups, first the dining hall then affordability category or the other way around, since the question did not specify. Thus you need to group by two items, which in babypandas needs to be done by inputting the two items in a list as an argument in the `groupby` function. 

<average>81</average>

**Answer (g):** `counts.get('Price')` or `counts.get('Calories')` or `counts.get('Item')`

For this part, you need to create a column called `'Count'` with the number of menu items that fall into each affordability category within each dining hall. Since the count function works by counting the number of non-null occurrences in each column within each group. If there are no null values, like in this case, then all the columns have the same values. This means you can use the values from any one of the non-index columns in the grouped dataframe as the `'Count'` column. In this case, those columns are `'Price'`, `'Calories'`, and `'Item'`. Therefore to fill in the blank, you would get any one of these columns.

<average>62</average>

**Answer (h):** `get(["Dining Hall", "Affordability", "Count"])`or `drop(columns=["Item", "Price", "Calories"])` columns can be in any order

Recall the question asked to create a dataframe with only three columns. You have just added one of the columns, `'Count'`. This means you have to drop the remaining columns (`'Price'`, `'Calories'`, and `'Item'`) or simply get the desired columns (`'Dining Hall'`, `'Affordability'`, and `'Count'`).

Suppose you determine that `"The Bistro"` is the dining hall with the
most menu items in the `"Cheap"` category, so you will drag yourself
there for every meal. Which of the following expressions must evaluate
to the number of `"Cheap"` menu items available at `"The Bistro"`?
**Select all that apply.**

[ ] `counts.sort_values(by="Count", ascending=False).get("Count").iloc[0]`
[ ] `counts.get("Count").max()`
[ ] `(counts[counts.get("Affordability") == "Cheap"].sort_values(by="Count").get("Count").iloc[-1])`
[ ] `counts[counts.get("Dining Hall") == "The Bistro"].get("Count").max()`
[ ] `counts[(counts.get("Affordability") == "Cheap") & (counts.get("Dining Hall") == "The Bistro")].get("Count").iloc[0]`
[ ] None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `(counts[counts.get("Affordability") == "Cheap"].sort_values(by="Count").get("Count").iloc[-1])` and `counts[(counts.get("Affordability") == "Cheap") & (counts.get("Dining Hall") == "The Bistro")].get("Count").iloc[0]`

- **Option 1**: This query sorts all rows by `"Count"` in descending order (largest to smallest) and selects the first row. This is incorrect because this does not filter by `"Cheap"` or `"The Bistro"`. This means that our query will pick the resturant with the highest count, without taking into consideration `"Cheap"` or `"The Bistro"`, which will not give us our desired result.

- **Option 2**: This query selects the highest value in `"Count"`. This is incorrect for the same reason: it neglects to query for `"Cheap"` or `"The Bistro"`, so it may return the count for another category or dining hall.

- **Option 3**: This query first filters `"counts"` to only include rows where `"Affordability"` is `"Cheap"`. Then, it sorts by `"Count"` in ascending order (smallest to largest). Since the question states that `"The Bistro"` has the most `"Cheap"` menu items, selecting the last row `(iloc[-1])` from the `"Count"` column correctly retrieves the number of `"Cheap"` menu items at `"The Bistro"`.

- **Option 4**: This query filters `"counts"` to only include rows where `"Dining Hall"` is `"The Bistro"`, then returns the maximum value in the `"Count"` column. However, `"The Bistro"` may have menu items in multiple affordability categories. This query does not isolate `"Cheap"` items, so it incorrectly returns the highest count across all affordability levels rather than just `"Cheap"`.

- **Option 5**: This query filters to find dining halls with `"Cheap"` affordabaility, and that are `"The Bistro"`. This query then selects the first (and only) row in the `"Count"` column, which correctly identifies the count of cheap items at `"The Bistro"`.
