Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the region in the `"Region"` column that comes first alphabetically.

```py
kart.groupby(___(a)___).count().index.___(b)___
```

What goes in (a)?

( ) `"Ranking"`
( ) `"Team"`
( ) `"Division"`
( ) `"Region"`

What goes in (b)?

( ) `"max()"`
( ) `"min()"`
( ) `"len()"`
( ) `"split()"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- (a) `"Region"`
- (b) `"min()"`

In order to curate a unique list of all the regions in the DataFrame, we want to `groupby` `â€œRegion"`. Using `count()` on this will count the number of observations for each region as a row in the DataFrame which does not really matter here since we just wanted the unique regions. `.index` will retrieve the list of all the unique regions. In order to get the first alphabetically, we can use `min()`.
