Which column of `kart` would work best as the index?

( ) `"Ranking"`
( ) `"Team"`
( ) `"Division"`
( ) `"Total Points"`


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Team"`

Recall a choice for a good index would be a column wherein the values would act as a unique identifier for a particular observation. The only column that suits this description would be `“Team”` since each row represents a unique team.

Write a line of python code that sets the index of `kart` to the column that you identified in part (1).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `kart = kart.set_index("Team")`

`set_index(“Team”)` sets the dataframe’s index to `“Team”`. We set this equal to `kart` to save this change.

Fill in the blanks below to complete the implementation of the function `division_to _int`, which takes in a string, `division`, the name of a division, and returns the division's number as an `int`. Example behavior is given below.

```py
  >>> division_to_int("Division1")
  1
  >>> division_to_int("Division2")
  2
```

```py
def division_to_int(division):
  __(i)__ __(ii)__(division.__(iii)__[__(iv)__])
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- (i) `return`
- (ii) `int`
- (iii) `split()` or `split(" ")`
- (iv) `-1` or `1`

Using the input `division`, we just want to retrieve the number. To accomplish this, we can use `split()` on the `division` to separate the string in order to access the number. Note that the default behavior of `split()` is to split by the space. 

The output of `division.split()` is now a list of `“Division”` and the number. To retrieve the number in this list, we can index for it with either `-1` (since it is the last element of the list) or `1` (since it is the second element in the list). Because we want the output to be an integer type, we use `int` to cast the value to an integer. Finally, to have the function output the desired value, we start with a `return` statement.

Write a *single* line of code that applies `division_to_int` to the existing
`"Division"` column, and updates the `"Division"` column in `kart`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `kart.assign(Division=kart.get("Division").apply(division_to_int))`

First let's start by getting the information we want for the new column. We get the column for transformation with `kart.get(“Division”)` and use `.apply(division_to_int)` in order to apply the function to this column. In order to update this transformed Series as a column `“Division”`, we use the `.assign` method on the DataFrame and set the transformed Series to the column name `“Division”`. Note that when using `.assign `to add a column and the chosen column name already exists, `.assign` will update the information in this column with the new input information.
