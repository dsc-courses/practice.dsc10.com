The DataFrame `div_one`, shown below to the **left**, contains the six Division 1 teams from `kart`, with just the `"Team"` and `"Region"` columns selected.

The DataFrame `coach`, shown below to the **right**, contains some additional information about the coaches of the teams in `div_one`, with a piece of info missing.

Fill in the blank in the `Region` column with either `South`, `West`, `East`, or `Midwest` so that the DataFrame `div_one.merge(coach, on="Region")` has:

- 8 rows: \_\_\_\_  
- 9 rows: \_\_\_\_  
- 10 rows: \_\_\_\_  
- 11 rows: \_\_\_\_  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  

- 8 rows: South  
- 9 rows: East  
- 10 rows: West  
- 11 rows: Midwest  

To determine the number of rows after merging two DataFrames (`div_one` and `coach`) on the column `"Region"`, we need to calculate how many matches occur for each region. When performing the merge, each row from `div_one` will be combined with every matching row in `coach`. The total number of rows in the resulting DataFrame will depend on how many times each region value in `div_one` has matching rows in `coach`.

1. **South (8 rows):**  
   - `div_one` has 3 rows with Midwest, and 1 row with East.  
   - `coach` has 2 rows with Midwest, and 2 rows with East.  
   - For each Midwest row in `div_one`, it matches with both Midwest rows in `coach`, resulting in `3×2=6` matches.  
   - The single East row in `div_one` matches with the 2 East rows in `coach`, contributing `1×2=2` matches.  
   - **Total for South:** `3 * 2(Midwest) + 1 * 2(East) = 8` rows.

2. **East (9 rows):**  
   - `div_one` has 3 rows with Midwest, and 1 row with East.  
   - `coach` has 2 rows with Midwest, and 3 rows with East.  
   - For each Midwest row in `div_one`, it matches with both Midwest rows in `coach`, giving `3×2=6` matches.  
   - The single East row in `div_one` matches with the 3 East rows in `coach`, contributing `1×3=3` matches.  
   - **Total for East:** `3 * 2(Midwest) + 1 * 3(East) = 9` rows.

3. **West (10 rows):**  
   - `div_one` has 3 rows with Midwest, 1 row with East, and 2 rows with West.  
   - `coach` has 2 rows with Midwest, 2 rows with East, and 1 row with West.  
   - For each Midwest row in `div_one`, it matches with both Midwest rows in `coach`, resulting in `3×2=6` matches.  
   - The single East row in `div_one` matches with the 2 East rows in `coach`, contributing `1×2=2` matches.  
   - The 2 West rows in `div_one` each match with the single West row in `coach`, contributing `2×1=2` matches.  
   - **Total for West:** `3 * 2(Midwest) + 1 * 2(East) + 2 * 1(West) = 10` rows.

4. **Midwest (11 rows):**  
   - `div_one` has 3 rows with Midwest, and 1 row with East.  
   - `coach` has 3 rows with Midwest, and 2 rows with East.  
   - For each Midwest row in `div_one`, it matches with all three Midwest rows in `coach`, resulting in `3×3=9` matches.  
   - The single East row in `div_one` matches with the 2 East rows in `coach`, contributing `1×2=2` matches.  
   - **Total for Midwest:** `3 * 3(Midwest) + 1 * 2(East) = 11` rows.

What is the value of the following Python expression?

```py
coach.merge(coach, on="Coach").merge(coach, on="Coach").shape[0]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 12

**First Merge:**
The expression starts by merging the coach DataFrame with itself on the "Coach" column. Each row in coach that has the same coach will match with every other row (including itself) that has the same coach.

- Matching process:
    - Coach Jason (rows 0 and 2): Matches with each other, creating 2×2=4 matches.
    - Coach Jack (row 1): Since this row only matches with itself, it creates 1×1=1 match.
    - Coach Ashley (row 3): Also creates 1×1=1 match.
    - Coach Nick (row 4): Again, 1×1=1 match.
    - Coach Zoe (row 5): Another 1×1=1 match.

Total rows from this merge: 4+1+1+1+1=8 rows.

**Second Merge:**
Now we take the result of the first merge (which has 8 rows) and merge it again with the original coach DataFrame on the "Coach" column.

- Matching process:
    - Coach Jason 4 rows (from the first merge): each of these rows will match with the 2 rows for "Coach Jason" in the original coach DataFrame. This results in 4×2=8 matches.
    - Coach Jack, Coach Ashley, Coach Nick, and Coach Zoe(all have single row): each will match with their corresponding rows in the original coach DataFrame. Since each has 1×1=1 match, we add 4 more rows in total.

Total rows from this merge: 8+1+1+1+1=12 rows.

**Result:**\
The expression returns the number of rows in the final merged DataFrame.\
Result: The final DataFrame has 12 rows.
