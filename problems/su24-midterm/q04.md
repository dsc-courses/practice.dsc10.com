Consider the scatterplot generated by the following expression:
  `kart.plot(kind="scatter, x="Total Points", y="Races Won")`

Which of the following questions would you be able to answer from this scatterplot? Select all that apply.

[ ] What is the name of the team that has the highest number of races won?
[ ] How many teams scored more than 6000 total points?
[ ] How many teams scored less than 100 total points per race that they won?
[ ] Which Division 2 school scored the most total points?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**: Option 2 and Option 3

- Option 1 is incorrect since the scatter plot shows all the observations based on the x and y values and they are not labeled by team. Thus, team information is not shown on this scatterplot.
- Option 4 is incorrect since the scatter plot does not label the teams and thus you would not know this information. 
- Option 2 is correct. Since the x axis is total points, you can count the number of observations that fall at x≥6000. 
- Option 3 is correct. The phrase “100 total points per race that they won” indicates a relationship between total points and races won. Since the x axis denotes total points and the y-axis represents races won, this relationship is simply the line x=100y. To answer this question, since we are interested in the number of teams that scored less than this, you can count the number of points below this line.
