Below are two density histograms representing the distribution of **Total Points** for Division 1 and the distribution of **Total Points** for Division 2 teams (remember, there are six teams in each division):

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Assuming we know the bin values for each histogram, what can we conclude from these two histograms? Select all that apply:

[ ] The number of teams in the rightmost bin on the histogram that displays the distribution of total points for Division 2 teams.
[ ] The number of Division 1 teams that scored 4000 points.
[ ] The number of Division 2 teams that scored between 2000 and 3000 points.
[ ] The number of Division 2 teams that scored fewer points than the lowest-scoring Division 1 team.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 1, 3, and 4

Since we are working with density histograms, each rectangle’s area represents the relative frequency of the corresponding bin. Given that there are six teams in each division, we can use the relative frequencies to approximate the number of teams in each bin.

---

- **Option 1 is correct:**
  - The rightmost bin on the histogram for Division 2 has a height of approximately 0.00017 and a width of 1000. The area of the bar, which represents the relative frequency for this bin, is calculated as follows:
    - Relative Frequency = 0.00017 × 1000 = 0.17
    - This indicates that around 17% of Division 2 teams fall within this bin. Given that there are six teams in Division 2, we can estimate the number of teams in this bin by:
    - 0.17 × 6 = 1.02, rounding to the nearest whole number, this results in approximately 1 team.

- **Option 2 is incorrect:**
  - From the Division 1 histogram, there is a bar covering a range that includes `4000` points. However, histograms display ranges rather than specific values. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of teams that scored exactly `4000` points from this histogram.

- **Option 3 is correct:**
  - Similarly, for the [2000, 3000) bin in Division 2, we can calculate the area of the bar and then multiply it by the total number of teams (6) to estimate the number of teams that fall within this range.

- **Option 4 is correct:**
  - The lowest-scoring bin for Division 1 is [3500, 4000). Division 2 has a bin that starts at a lower range [2000, 3000), which is below Division 1’s minimum bin. Therefore, we can determine the number of Division 2 teams that scored fewer points than the lowest-scoring Division 1 team.

Suppose that we changed the histogram of total points for Division 2 teams so that the bins were `[2000, 4000), [4000, 6000), [6000, 8000)`. If the bin defined by `[2000, 4000)` contained one team, as it does in the original graph, what would the height of the middle bar (with bin `[4000, 6000)`) be? Do not simplify your answer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 1/3000

First, we need to calculate the number of teams that scored in the range of [4000,6000) in the original histogram for Division 2 teams:

Area of bar in bin[4000, 5000) * 6 + Area of bar in bin[5000, 6000) * 6 = 0.0005 * 1000 * 6 + 0.00017 * 1000 * 6 = 4.02

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we find that approximately 4 teams fall within this range.

Next, we want to calculate the height of the bar with bin [4000, 6000) in the new histogram. Using the fact that this bin should contain 4 teams, we have:

Height * Width * 6 = 4

Solving for the height:

Height = 4 / (6 * 2000) = 1 / 3000

<average>64</average>

Suppose we drew different bins for the histogram of total points for Division 2 teams. If the bin defined by `[2000, 4000)` contained one team, as it does in the original graph, and the bin defined by `[4000, 4500)` contained two teams, what would the height of the bar with bin `[4500, 5000)` be? Do not simplify your answer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 1/3000

In the original histogram, the bin defined by `[4000, 5000)` contained:

0.0005 * 1000 * 6 = 3 teams  

According to the description, the bin defined by `[4000, 4500)` contained 2 teams.

Therefore, we can conclude that the bin defined by `[4500, 5000)` contained:

3 - 2 = 1 team  

In the bin `[4500, 5000)` of the new histogram, we have:

Height * Width * 6 = 1

Solving for the height:

Height = 1 / (6 * Width) = 1 / (6 * 500) = 1/3000

<average>32</average>
