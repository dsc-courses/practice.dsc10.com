# BEGIN PROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the `"University"` of the lowest scoring Division 2 team over the whole season.

```py 
kart[__(a)__].__(b)__(__(c)__).get("University").iloc[0]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- **\(a\)** `kart.get("Division") == "Division 2"`
- **\(b\)** `sort values`
- **\(c\)** `"Total Points"` or `by="Total Points"`

First we want to filter the DataFrame for only the Division 2 teams using `kart.get("Division") == "Division 2"`. 

Since we are interested in the lowest scoring team in this division, we want to use `sort_values` on the `"Total Points"` column giving `sort_values(by= “Total Points”)`. Since we are retrieving `.iloc[0]`, i.e. the top row of the DataFrame, we do not have to specify the order of ranking since the default behavior of `sort_values` is ascending. 


<average>74</average>
<average>90</average>
<average>86</average>
