# BEGIN PROB

We want to estimate the probability that the University of Michigan is among the four teams selected when schools are selected **without replacement**.

```python
schools = np.array(kart.get("University"))
mystery_one = 0
num_trials = 10000
for i in np.arange(num_trials):
    bracket = __(i)__
    if "Michigan" in bracket:
        mystery_one = __(ii)__
mystery_two = mystery_one / num_trials
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks to complete a simulation.

- (i):  ________________________________________
  

- (ii): ________________________________________
  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** \

- (i) ```np.random.choice(schools, 4, replace=False)```\
- (ii) ```mystery_one = mystery_one + 1```

(i) np.random.choice() allows us to select random samples from the `schools` array. The correct syntax is **np.random.choice(arr, size, replace=True, p=[p_0, p_1, ...])**

- arr: The array to sample from. In this case, `schools`.
- size: The number of elements to draw. In this case, `4`, because we want to select four teams.
- replace: A boolean value that determines if the same item can be chosen more than once. Since teams cannot be picked more than once in a single selection, we use `replace=False.`
- p: An parameter that sets the probabilities for each item in arr. If omitted, the function assumes each item has an equal chance of being selected. In this problem, we do not need to specify p because we are performing uniform random sampling, meaning every team has an equal chance.

(ii) This blank updates ```mystery_one```, which counts how many times "Michigan" appears in the randomly selected teams across the trials. In each iteration of the loop, if "Michigan" is in the randomly selected bracket, we increment ```mystery_one``` by 1.

What is the meaning of `mystery_two` after the code has finished running?
( ) The number of times Michigan was in the tournament
( ) The number of trials we ran
( ) The proportion of times Michigan was in the tournament
( ) None of these answers is what `mystery_two` represents

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The proportion of times Michigan was in the tournament

If "Michigan" is found in bracket,  ```mystery_one``` is incremented by 1. This means ```mystery_one``` keeps track of how many times Michigan appears in the four selected teams across all 10,000 trials.
Therefore, at the end of the loop, ```mystery_one``` contains the total number of trials in which Michigan was selected.

```mystery_two``` is calculated as **mystery_one / num_trials.**
Since ```mystery_one``` is the count of trials where Michigan was selected, dividing it by num_trials (the total number of trials) gives the proportion of trials where Michigan was chosen among the four teams.

For the next two parts only, imagine we wanted to simulate a 16-team tournament, where teams are selected **with replacement**. Which blank should be filled in?

( ) blank (i)
( ) blank (ii)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** blank (i)

When simulating a 16-team tournament, where teams are selected with replacement, Blank (i) should be used because that is where the selection occurs. We need to adjust this line to account for selecting more teams (16 teams) and to allow replacements. 

<average>67</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What code should be used to fill in the blank you selected above?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  ```np.random.choice(schools, 16, replace=True)```

We change size=4 to size=16 to select 16 teams, and replace=True allows the same team to be selected multiple times within a single trial.

<average>45</average>
