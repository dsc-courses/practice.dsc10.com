# BEGIN PROB

Bill is curious about whether his bookstore is busier on weekends
(Saturday, Sunday) or weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday). To help figure this out, he wants to define some helpful
one-line functions.

The function `find_day` should take in a given `"date"` and return the
associated day of the week. For example,
`find_day("Saturday, December 7, 2024")` should evaluate to
`"Saturday"`.

The function `is_weekend` should take in a given `"date"` and return
`True` if that date is on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.
For example, `is_weekend("Saturday, December 7, 2024")` should evaluate
to `True`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Complete the implementation of both functions below.

    def find_day(date):
        return date.__(a)__

    def weekend(date):
        return find_day(date)[__(b)__] == __(c)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a). **Answer**: `split(",")[0]`
<average>89</average>

(b). **Answer**: `0`
<average>74</average>

(c). **Answer**: `"S"`
<average>50</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Now, Bill runs the following line of code:

    sales_day = sales.assign(weekend = sales.get("date").apply(is_weekend))

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Determine which of the following code snippets evaluates to the
proportion of book purchases in `sales` that were made on a weekend.
**Select all that apply.**

[ ] `sales_day[sales_day.get("weekend")].count() / sales_day.shape[0]`
[ ] `sales[sales_day.get("weekend")].shape[0] / sales_day.shape[0]`
[ ] `sales_day.get("weekend").median()`
[ ] `sales_day.get("weekend").mean()`
[ ] `np.count_nonzero(sales_day.get("weekend") > 0.5) / sales_day.shape[0]`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

- `sales[sales_day.get("weekend")].shape[0] / sales_day.shape[0]`
- `sales_day.get("weekend").mean()`
- `np.count_nonzero(sales_day.get("weekend") > 0.5) / sales_day.shape[0]`

<average>72</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
