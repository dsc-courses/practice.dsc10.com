Notice that `bookstore` has an index of `"ISBN"` and `sales` does not.
Why is that?

( ) There is no good reason. We could have set the index of `sales` to `"ISBN"`.
( ) There can be two different books with the same `"ISBN"`.
( ) `"ISBN"` is already being used as the index of `bookstore`, so it shouldn't also be used as the index of `sales`.
( ) The bookstore can sell multiple copies of the same book.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The bookstore can sell multiple copies of the same book.

In the `sales` DataFrame, each row represents an individual sale, meaning multiple rows can have the same `"ISBN"` if multiple copies of the same book are sold. Therefore we can't use it as the index because it is not a unique identifier for rows of `sales`.

Is `"ISBN"` a numerical or categorical variable?

( ) numerical 
( ) categorical

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** categorical

Even though `"ISBN"` consists of numbers, it is used to identify and categorize books rather than to quantify or measure anything, thus it is categorical. It doesn't make sense to compare ISBN numbers like you would compare numbers on a number line, or to do arithmetic with ISBN numbers.

Which type of data visualization should be used to compare authors by
median rating?

( ) line plot 
( ) bar chart

**Answer:** bar chart

 A bar chart is best, as it visualizes numerical values (median ratings) across discrete categories (authors).
