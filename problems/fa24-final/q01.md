Notice that `bookstore` has an index of `"ISBN"` and `sales` does not.
Why is that?

( ) There is no good reason. We could have set the index of `sales` to
`"ISBN"`.
( ) There can be two different books with the same `"ISBN"`.
( ) `"ISBN"` is already being used as the index of `bookstore`, so it
shouldn't also be used\
as the index of `sales`.
( ) The bookstore can sell multiple copies of the same book.
