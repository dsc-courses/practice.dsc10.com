\[(21 pts)\] Dhruv works at the bookstore, and his job involves pricing
new books that come in from the supplier. He prices new books based on
the number of pages they have. He does this using linear regression,
which he learned about in DSC 10.

To build his regression line, Dhruv gathers the following information
about the distinct books currently available at the bookstore:

-   The correlation between price and number of pages is $0.6$.

-   The mean price of all books is \$15, with a standard deviation of
    \$4.

-   The mean number of pages of all books is 500, with a standard
    deviation of 200.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following statements about Dhruv's regression line are
true? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] It goes through the point $(500, 15).$
[ ] It goes through the point $(200, 4).$
[ ] Its slope is equal to $0.6$.
[ ] Its $y$-intercept is equal to $9$.
[ ] Its root mean square error is larger than the root mean square
error of any other\
line.
[ ] All the books currently available at the bookstore fall on the
line.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** a, d

When performing linear regression analysis, the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`) of the regression line can be calculated as follows:

$$ m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of } x}  = 0.6 \times \left(\frac{4}{200}\right) = 0.012 $$


$$ b = (\text{mean of } y) - m \cdot (\text{mean of } x) = 15 - 0.012 \times 500 = 9  $$

To predict the dependent variable ($y_i$) based on the independent variable ($x_i$):
$$ \text{predicted } y_i = 0.012 \cdot x_i + 9 $$


(a) **True.** The regression line will always pass through the point ($\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$) due to the way we calculate it, which is $(500, 15)$ in this case.

(b) **False.** $y = 0.012 \cdot 200 + 9 = 2.4 + 9 = 11.4 \neq 4$

(c) **False.** As calculated, the slope of the regression line is $0.012$, not $0.6$. The correlation coefficient is not the slope.

(d) **True.** The intercept, based on the mean values and the calculated slope, is $9$.

(e) **False.** The least squares regression line minimizes the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to any other possible regression lines.

(f) **False.** Regression provides a prediction or estimation, not an exact accounting. Not all books will fall exactly on the regression line due to the inherent variability and other influencing factors not accounted for in the simple linear model.

If `"The Martian"` has $30$ more pages than `"The Simple Wild"`, and
both books are priced according to the regression line, how much more
does `"The Martian"` cost than `"The Simple Wild"`? Give your answer as
a number, in dollars and cents.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.36

Given the regression equation(calculated in previous question):
$$ \text{predicted } y_i = 0.012 \cdot x_i + 9 $$

Assume:

- $x_i$ for "The Simple Wild" is $x$.
- $x_j$ for "The Martian" is $x + 30$.


- Predicted price for "The Simple Wild" ($y_i$):
  $$ y_i = 0.012 \cdot x + 9 $$

- Predicted price for "The Martian" ($y_j$):
  $$ y_j = 0.012 \cdot (x + 30) + 9 $$
  $$ y_j = 0.012 \cdot x + 0.36 + 9 $$
  $$ y_j = 0.012 \cdot x + 9.36 $$


The price of "The Martian" minus the price of "The Simple Wild":
$$ y_j - y_i = (0.012 \cdot x + 9.36) - (0.012 \cdot x + 9) = 9.36 - 9 = 0.36 $$

A new book added to the inventory is `"The Goldfinch"`, which has $700$
pages. How much should Dhruv charge customers for this book, according
to the regression line pricing model? Give your answer as a number, in
dollars and cents.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 17.4

Given the regression equation(calculated in (a)): $$ \text{predicted } y_i = 0.012 \cdot x_i + 9 $$

"The Goldfinch" has 700 pages.
Substitute into the regression equation: $$ y_i = 0.012 \cdot 700 + 9  = 8.4 + 9 = 17.4 $$

It turns out that Dhruv had an error in his regression line because he
had accidentally recorded the price of one book in the data set,
`"Roadside Picnic"`, as $-\$12$ instead of $\$12$. He builds a new
regression line using the correct price for `"Roadside Picnic"` and he
finds that his new regression line has a smaller slope than before. What
can we conclude about the number of pages in `"Roadside Picnic"` based
on this information alone?

( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has fewer than 500 pages.
( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has exactly 500 pages.
( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has more than 500 pages.
( ) Not enough information.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

 **Answer**: `"Roadside Picnic"` has fewer than 500 pages.

The linear regression line has to pass through the point (500, 15). 

- Fewer Than 500 Pages: If "Roadside Picnic" has fewer than 500 pages, then this point is toward the left side of the pivot point of the regression line, and price -12 will drag the line down(towards the lower left corner) more than 12 does, so the slope will decrease if price changes from -12 to 12.\

- Exactly 500 Pages: If the book has exactly 500 pages, which is the mean or center of the data distribution, the incorrect price would mainly influence the intercept rather than the slope. Correcting the price would adjust the intercept but have a lesser effect on the slope.

- More Than 500 Pages: If "Roadside Picnic" has more than 500 pages, then itâ€™s toward the right side of the regression line, and price -12 will drag the line down(towards the lower right corner)  more than 12 does, so correcting this error would increase the slope.\

Suppose that Dhruv originally based his regression line on a data set
which has a single row for each unique book sold at Bill's Book Bonanza.
If instead, he had used a dataset with one row for each copy of a book
at the bookstore (and there are multiple copies of some books), would
his regression line have come out the same?

( ) Yes 
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No

The regression line would not be the same due to the change in data and the resulting impact on mean and standard deviation of the price and pages.

Suppose Dhruv bootstraps his scatterplot 10,000 times and calculates a
regression line for each resample. It turns out that $95\%$ of his
bootstrapped slopes fall in the interval $[a, b]$ and $95\%$ of his
bootstrapped intercepts fall in the interval $[c, d]$. Does this mean
that $95\%$ of his predicted prices for a book with 500 pages fall in
the interval $[500a+c, 500b+d]$?

( ) Yes 
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No

95% of bootstrapped slopes and intercepts fall within specific intervals does not imply that 95% of predicted prices for a book with 500 pages will also fall within the interval [500a + c, 500b + d]. Because the intervals for slopes and intercepts are calculated independently, their combination does not account for the covariance between these regression parameters or the error variance around predictions. Additionally, combining slope and intercept independently can result in regression lines that do not pass through the pivotal point (mean(X), mean(Y)), making them unreliable for accurate prediction.
