\[(21 pts)\] Dhruv works at the bookstore, and his job involves pricing
new books that come in from the supplier. He prices new books based on
the number of pages they have. He does this using linear regression,
which he learned about in DSC 10.

To build his regression line, Dhruv gathers the following information
about the distinct books currently available at the bookstore:

-   The correlation between price and number of pages is $0.6$.

-   The mean price of all books is \$15, with a standard deviation of
    \$4.

-   The mean number of pages of all books is 500, with a standard
    deviation of 200.

Which of the following statements about Dhruv's regression line are
true? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] It goes through the point $(500, 15).$
[ ] It goes through the point $(200, 4).$
[ ] Its slope is equal to $0.6$.
[ ] Its $y$-intercept is equal to $9$.
[ ] Its root mean square error is larger than the root mean square
error of any other\
line.
[ ] All the books currently available at the bookstore fall on the
line.

If `"The Martian"` has $30$ more pages than `"The Simple Wild"`, and
both books are priced according to the regression line, how much more
does `"The Martian"` cost than `"The Simple Wild"`? Give your answer as
a number, in dollars and cents.

A new book added to the inventory is `"The Goldfinch"`, which has $700$
pages. How much should Dhruv charge customers for this book, according
to the regression line pricing model? Give your answer as a number, in
dollars and cents.

It turns out that Dhruv had an error in his regression line because he
had accidentally recorded the price of one book in the data set,
`"Roadside Picnic"`, as $-\$12$ instead of $\$12$. He builds a new
regression line using the correct price for `"Roadside Picnic"` and he
finds that his new regression line has a smaller slope than before. What
can we conclude about the number of pages in `"Roadside Picnic"` based
on this information alone?

( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has fewer than 500 pages.
( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has exactly 500 pages.
( ) `"Roadside Picnic"` has more than 500 pages.
( ) Not enough information.

Suppose that Dhruv originally based his regression line on a data set
which has a single row for each unique book sold at Bill's Book Bonanza.
If instead, he had used a dataset with one row for each copy of a book
at the bookstore (and there are multiple copies of some books), would
his regression line have come out the same?

( ) Yes 
( ) No

Suppose Dhruv bootstraps his scatterplot 10,000 times and calculates a
regression line for each resample. It turns out that $95\%$ of his
bootstrapped slopes fall in the interval $[a, b]$ and $95\%$ of his
bootstrapped intercepts fall in the interval $[c, d]$. Does this mean
that $95\%$ of his predicted prices for a book with 500 pages fall in
the interval $[500a+c, 500b+d]$?

( ) Yes 
( ) No
