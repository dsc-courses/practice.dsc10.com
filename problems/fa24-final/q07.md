# BEGIN PROB

Hargen is an employee at Bill's Book Bonanza who tends to
work weekend shifts. He thinks that Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are
busier than other days, and he proposes the following probability
distribution of sales by day:

::: center
  Sunday   Monday   Tuesday   Wednesday   Thursday   Friday   Saturday
  -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------
  $0.2$    $0.1$    $0.1$     $0.1$       $0.1$      $0.2$    $0.2$
:::

Let's use the data in `sales` to determine whether Hargen's proposed
model could be correct by doing a hypothesis test. The hypotheses are:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: Sales at the bookstore are randomly drawn from
    Hargen's proposed distribution of days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: Sales at the bookstore are not randomly
    drawn from Hargen's proposed distribution of days.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following test statistics could be used to test the given
hypothesis? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] The absolute difference between the proportion of books sold on Saturday and the proposed proportion of books sold on Saturday ($0.2$).
[ ] The sum of the differences in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.
[ ] One half of the sum of the absolute differences in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

- The sum of the squared differences in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.
- One half of the sum of the absolute differences in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.

Let's look at each of the options:

- Option 1: Incorrect. It is only comparing one day instead of the entire distribution.
- Option 2: Incorrect. Positive and negative differences, if both exist, can partially cancel out. We would not be able to tell how big the difference is.
- Option 3: Correct. Squared difference avoids the issue of positive and negative differences canceling out.
- Option 4: Correct. Absolute difference also avoids the issue of positive and negative differences canceling out. Furthermore, this is the definition of Total Variation Distance (TVD), which is a common statistic for comparing categorical distributions.

# END SUBPROB

We will use as our test statistic **the mean of the absolute differences
in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and
Hargen's proposed distribution.**

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the observed distribution of books sold by day was as follows.
Calculate the observed statistic in this case.

::: center
  Sunday   Monday   Tuesday   Wednesday   Thursday   Friday   Saturday
  -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------
  $0.34$   $0.13$   $0.06$    $0.07$      $0.08$     $0.08$   $0.24$
:::

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.06

$$\frac{|0.34 - 0.2| + |0.13 - 0.1| + |0.06 - 0.1| + |0.07 - 0.1| + |0.08 - 0.1| + |0.08 - 0.2| + |0.24 - 0.2|}{7}$$

$$= \frac{0.14 + 0.03 + 0.04 + 0.03 + 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.04}{7}$$

$$= \frac{0.42}{7} = 0.06$$

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let's determine the actual value of the observed statistic based on the
data in `sales`. Assume that we have already defined a function called
`find_day` that returns the day of the week for a given `"date"`. For
example, `find_day("Saturday, December 7, 2024")` evaluates to
`"Saturday"`. Fill in the blanks below so that the variable `obs`
evaluates to the observed statistic.

    # in alphabetical order: Fri, Mon, Sat, Sun, Thurs, Tues, Wed
    hargen = np.array([0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]) 
    prop = (sales.assign(day_of_week = __(a)__)
                 .groupby(__(b)__).__(c)__.get("ISBN") / sales.shape[0])
    obs = __(d)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a). **Answer**: `sales.get("date").apply(find_day)`

In this blank, we want to create a Series that contains days of the week, such as `"Saturday"`, to be assigned to a column named `day_of_week` in `sales`. We take the `"date"` column in `sales` and apply the function `find_day` to each of the date in the column.

<average>77</average>

(b). **Answer**: `"day_of_week"`

We want to group the `sales` DataFrame by the `day_of_week` column that was created in blank (a) to collect together all rows corresponding to the same day of the week.

<average>84</average>

(c). **Answer**: `count()`

We want to count how many sales occured on each day of the week, or, how many rows are in `sales` that belong to each day, so we use `count()` after grouping by `day_of_week`.

<average>71</average>

(d). **Answer**: `(np.abs(prop - hargen)).mean()`

We first take one column that contains the count of rows for each day of the week, indexed by the days in alphabetical order after the groupby. We then divide this column by the total number of rows to get proportions. We want to compute the statistic that we've chosen, the mean of absolute differences in proportions between the observed and Hargen's proposed distribution. Since the order of the days already match (both in alphabetical order), we can simply subtract one from the other to get the difference in proportions. We then turn the differences into absolute differences with `np.abs` and get the mean using `.mean()`.

<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

To conduct the hypothesis test, we'll need to generate thousands of
simulated day-of-the-week distributions. What will we do with all these
simulated distributions?

( ) Use them to determine whether Hargen's proposed distribution looks like a typical simulated distribution.
( ) Use them to determine whether the observed distribution of books sold by day looks like a typical simulated distribution.
( ) Use them to determine whether Hargen's proposed distribution looks like a typical observed distribution of books sold by day.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Use them to determine whether the observed distribution of books
sold by day looks like a typical simulated distribution.

For hypothesis testing, we simulate based on the null distribution, which is the distribution that Hargen proposed. For each of the simulated distribution of proportions , we calculate the statistic we chose, which is **the mean of the absolute differences in proportions between the simulated and Hargen's proposed distributions**. After many simulations, we have calculated thousands of mean of absolute differences in proportions, each between one simulated distribution and Hargen's proposed distribution. Lastly, we compare the observed statistic with the statistics from the simulations to see whether **the observed distribution of books sold by day looks like a typical simulated distribution.**

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In each iteration of the simulation, we need to collect a sample of size
`sales.shape[0]` from which distribution?

( ) Hargen's proposed distribution.
( ) The distribution of data in `sales` by day of the week.
( ) Our original sample's distribution.
( ) The distribution of possible sample means.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Hargen's proposed distribution.

For hypothesis testing, we simulate based on the null distribution, which is the distribution that Hargen proposed. 

<average>26</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that `obs` comes out to be in the 98th percentile of simulated
test statistics. Using the standard p-value cutoff of 0.05, what would
Hargen conclude about his original model?

( ) It is likely correct. 
( ) It is plausible. 
( ) It is likely wrong.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: It is likely wrong.

Using the standard p-value cutoff of 0.05, we say that the observed distribution is not like a typical simulated distribution under Hargen's proposed distribution if it falls below 2.5th percentile of above 97.5th percentile. In this case, 98th percentile is above 97.5th percentile, so we say that Hargen's proposed distribution is likely wrong.
