Hargen is an employee at Bill's Book Bonanza who tends to
work weekend shifts. He thinks that Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are
busier than other days, and he proposes the following probability
distribution of sales by day:

::: center
  Sunday   Monday   Tuesday   Wednesday   Thursday   Friday   Saturday
  -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------
  $0.2$    $0.1$    $0.1$     $0.1$       $0.1$      $0.2$    $0.2$
:::

Let's use the data in `sales` to determine whether Hargen's proposed
model could be correct by doing a hypothesis test. The hypotheses are:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: Sales at the bookstore are randomly drawn from
    Hargen's proposed distribution of days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: Sales at the bookstore are not randomly
    drawn from Hargen's proposed distribution of days.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following test statistics could be used to test the given
hypothesis? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] The absolute difference between the proportion of books sold on
Saturday and the\
proposed proportion of books sold on Saturday ($0.2$).
[ ] The sum of the differences in proportions between the distribution
of books sold by\
day and Hargen's proposed distribution.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between the
distribution of books\
sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.
[ ] One half of the sum of the absolute differences in proportions
between the distri-\
bution of books sold by day and Hargen's proposed distribution.

# BEGIN SOLUTION


<average>74</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

We will use as our test statistic **the mean of the absolute differences
in proportions between the distribution of books sold by day and
Hargen's proposed distribution.**

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the observed distribution of books sold by day was as follows.
Calculate the observed statistic in this case.

::: center
  Sunday   Monday   Tuesday   Wednesday   Thursday   Friday   Saturday
  -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------
  $0.34$   $0.13$   $0.06$    $0.07$      $0.08$     $0.08$   $0.24$

Let's determine the actual value of the observed statistic based on the
data in `sales`. Assume that we have already defined a function called
`find_day` that returns the day of the week for a given `"date"`. For
example, `find_day("Saturday, December 7, 2024")` evaluates to
`"Saturday"`. Fill in the blanks below so that the variable `obs`
evaluates to the observed statistic.

    # in alphabetical order: Fri, Mon, Sat, Sun, Thurs, Tues, Wed
    hargen = np.array([0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]) 
    prop = (sales.assign(day_of_week = __(a)__)
                 .groupby(__(b)__).__(c)__.get("ISBN") / sales.shape[0])
    obs = __(d)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a)
<average>77</average>

(b)
<average>84</average>

(c)
<average>71</average>

(d)
<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

To conduct the hypothesis test, we'll need to generate thousands of
simulated day-of-the-week distributions. What will we do with all these
simulated distributions?

( ) Use them to determine whether Hargen's proposed distribution looks
like a typical\
simulated distribution.
( ) Use them to determine whether the observed distribution of books
sold by day looks\
like a typical simulated distribution.
( ) Use them to determine whether Hargen's proposed distribution looks
like a typical\
observed distribution of books sold by day.

# BEGIN SOLUTION


<average>28</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In each iteration of the simulation, we need to collect a sample of size
`sales.shape[0]` from which distribution?

( ) Hargen's proposed distribution.
( ) The distribution of data in `sales` by day of the week.
( ) Our original sample's distribution.
( ) The distribution of possible sample means.

# BEGIN SOLUTION


<average>26</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that `obs` comes out to be in the 98th percentile of simulated
test statistics. Using the standard p-value cutoff of 0.05, what would
Hargen conclude about his original model?

( ) It is likely correct. 
( ) It is plausible. 
( ) It is likely wrong.
