# BEGIN PROB

Aathi is a movie enthusiast looking to dive into
book-reading. He visits Bill's Book Bonanza and asks for help from the
employee on duty, Matilda.

Matilda has access to the `matilda` DataFrame of transactions from her
shifts, as well as the `bookstore` DataFrame of all books available in
the store. She decides to advise Aathi based on the ratings of books
that are popular enough to have been purchased during her shifts.
Unfortunately, `matilda` does not contain information about the rating
or genre of the books sold. To fix this, she merges the two DataFrames
and keeps only the columns that she'll need.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the resulting `merged`
DataFrame has one row for each book in `matilda`, and columns
representing the genre and rating of each such book.

    merged = (matilda.merge(bookstore, __(a)__, __(b)__)
                     .get(["genre", "rating"]))

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a) `left_on = "ISBN"`

(b) `right_index = True`

Since each `"ISBN"` uniquely identifies a book, we can merge on that. We use `right_index=True` because `"ISBN"` is the index in `bookstore`, not a column. We need to match it with the `"ISBN"` column in `matilda`.

<average>60</average>



# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In this example, `matilda` and `merged` have the same number of rows.
Why is this the case? Choose the answer which is sufficient alone to
guarantee the same number of rows.

( ) Because every book in `bookstore` appears exactly once in `matilda`.
( ) Because every book in `matilda` appears exactly once in `bookstore`.
( ) Because `matilda` has no duplicate rows.
( ) Because `bookstore` has no duplicate rows.
( ) Because the books in `matilda` are a subset of the books in `bookstore`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  Because every book in `matilda` appears exactly once in `bookstore`.

Think about the merging process. Imagine we go through each row of `matilda`, one row at a time, and look for corresponding rows that match in `bookstore`. If each row of `matilda` matches with exactly one row of `bookstore`, then the merged DataFrame must have the same number of rows as `matilda` started with. 

<average>53</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Matilda uses some `babypandas` operations on the `merged` DataFrame to
create the DataFrame pictured below, which she calls `top_two`.

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/fm_A.jpg' width=200></center>

This DataFrame shows the two genres in `merged` with the highest mean
rating. Note that the `"rating"` column in `top_two` represents a mean
rating across many books of the same genre, not the rating of any
individual book.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write one line of code to define the DataFrame `top_two` as described
above. It's okay if you need to write your answer on multiple lines, as
long as it represents one line of code.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `top_two = merged.groupby("genre").mean().sort_values(by="rating", ascending=False).drop(columns="pages").take([0, 1])`

We first groupby the `merged` DataFrame by `"genre"` and calculates the mean rating for each genre. Then we sort these genres by their average rating in descending order so the higest rated are at the top. Then, `"pages"` is dropped since it's not needed in our output. Finally, we select the top two genres with the highest average ratings using `.take([0, 1])`, which keeps only the first two rows.

<average>67</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Based on the data in `top_two`, Matilda recommends that Aathi purchase a
fantasy book. However, Aathi is skeptical because he recognizes that the
data in `merged` is only a sample from the larger population of all
transactions at Bill's Book Bonanza. Before he makes his purchase, he
decides to do a permutation test to determine whether fantasy books have
higher ratings than mystery books in this larger population.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Select the best statement of the null hypothesis for this permutation
test.

( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books have a higher rating than mystery books, on average.
( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books do not have a higher rating than mystery books, on average.
( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books have the same rating as mystery books, on average.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Among all books sold at Bill’s Book Bonanza, fantasy books have the same rating as mystery books, on average.

The null hypothesis for a permutation test assumes that there is no difference in the population means, implying that fantasy and mystery books have the same average ratings.


<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Select the best statement of the alternative hypothesis for this
permutation test.

( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books have a higher rating than mystery books, on average.
( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books do not have a higher rating than mystery books, on average.
( ) Among all books sold at Bill's Book Bonanza, fantasy books have the same rating as mystery books, on average.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  Among all books sold at Bill’s Book Bonanza, fantasy books have a higher rating than mystery books, on average.

The alternative hypothesis is that that fantasy books have higher ratings than mystery books, representing the claim being tested against the null hypothesis.

<average>69</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Aathi decides to use the mean rating for mystery books minus the mean
rating for fantasy books as his test statistic. What is his observed
value of this statistic?
 
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** -0.12

This comes from subtracting the values provided in the grouped DataFrame in the order mystery minus fantasy: $4.53 - 4.65 = -0.12$.

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following best describes how Aathi will interpret the
results of his permutation test?

( ) High values of the observed statistic will make him lean towards the alternative hypothesis.
( ) Low values of the observed statistic will make him lean towards the alternative hypothesis.
( ) Both high and low values of the observed statistic will make him lean towards the alternative hypothesis.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Low values of the observed statistic will make him lean towards the alternative hypothesis.

Since we are subtracting in the order mystery rating minus fantasy rating, a low (negative) observed statistic would indicate that fantasy books have higher ratings than mystery books. So low values would cause us to reject the null in favor of the alternative.

<average>66</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the following code to perform Aathi's permutation
test.

    just_two = merged[(merged.get("genre") == "Fantasy") |
                      (merged.get("genre") == "Mystery")]

    rating_stats = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        shuffled = just_two.assign(shuffled = __(a)__)
        grouped = shuffled.groupby("genre").mean().get("shuffled")
        mystery_mean = grouped.iloc[__(b)__]
        fantasy_mean = grouped.iloc[__(c)__]
        rating_stats = np.append(rating_stats, mystery_mean - fantasy_mean)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a) `np.random.permutation(just_two.get("rating"))`

We have to permute the `"rating"` column because of the code provided on the next line, which groups by genre.

<average>75</average>

(b) `1`

It's important for this question to know that `.groupby("genre") sorts genres alphabetically. In this case, the genre `"Fantasy"` is before `"Mystery"` alphabetically, `"Mystery"` corresponds to the second row (`iloc[1]`).
<average>57</average>

(c) `0`
<average>60</average>

`"Fantasy"` is located in the first row, so we use `iloc[0]`.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Aathi gets a `p_value` of $0.008$, and he will base his purchase on this
result, using the standard p-value cutoff of $0.05$. What will Aathi end
up doing?

( ) Aathi fails to reject the null hypothesis and will purchase a fantasy book.
( ) Aathi fails to reject the null hypothesis and will purchase a mystery book.
( ) Aathi rejects the null hypothesis and will purchase a fantasy book.
( ) Aathi rejects the null hypothesis and will purchase a mystery book.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  Aathi rejects the null hypothesis and will purchase a fantasy book.

The p-value is lower than our cutoff of $0.05$ so we reject the null hypothesis because our observed data doesn't look like the data we simulated under the assumptions of the null hypothesis.
