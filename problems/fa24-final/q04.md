# BEGIN PROB

Matilda has been working at Bill's Book Bonanza since it
first opened and her shifts for each week are always randomly scheduled
(i.e., she does not work the same shifts each week). Due to the system
restrictions at the bookstore, when Matilda logs in with her employee
ID, she only has access to the history of sales made during her shifts.
Suppose these transactions are stored in a DataFrame called `matilda`,
which has the same columns as the `sales` DataFrame that stores all
transactions.

Matilda wants to use her random sample to estimate **the mean price of
books purchased with cash** at Bill's Book Bonanza. For the purposes of
this question, assume Matilda only has access to `matilda`, and not all
of `sales`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Complete the code below so that `cash_left` and `cash_right` store the
endpoints of an $86\%$ bootstrapped confidence interval for the mean
price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza.

        cash_means = np.array([])
        original = __(a)__
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            resample = original.sample(__(b)__)
            cash_means = np.append(cash_means, __(c)__)

        cash_left = __(d)__
        cash_right = __(e)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a) `matilda[matilda.get("cash")]`

We first filter the `matilda` DataFrame to only include rows where the payment method was cash, since these are the only rows that are relevant to our question of the mean price of books purchased with cash.

<average>65</average>

(b) `original.shape[0], replace = True`

We repeatedly resample from this filtered data. We always bootstrap using the same sample size as the original sample, and with replacement.

<average>79</average>

(c) `resample.get("price").mean()`

Our statistic is the mean price, which we need to calculate from the `resample` DataFrame.

<average>71</average>

(d) `np.percentile(cash_means, 7)`

Since our goal is to construct an $86%$ confidence interval, we take the $7^{th}$ percentile as the left endpoint and the $93^{rd}$ percentile as the right endpoint. These numbers come from $100 - 86 = 14$, which means we want $14\%$ of the area excluded from our interval, and we want to split that up evenly with $7\%$ on each side.

<average>84</average>

(e) `np.percentile(cash_means, 93)`

<average>84</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Next, Matilda uses the data in `matilda` to construct a $95\%$ CLT-based
confidence interval for the same parameter.

Given that there are 400 cash transactions in `matilda` and her
confidence interval comes out as $[19.58, 21.58]$, what is the standard
deviation of the prices of all cash transactions at Bill's Book Bonanza?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 10

The width of the interval is $21.58 - 19.58 = 2$. Using the formula for the width of a $95\%$ CLT-based
confidence interval and solving for the standard deviation gives the answer.

$Width = 4 * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{400}}$

$SD = 2 * \frac{\sqrt{400}}{4} = 10$

<average>61</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Knowing the endpoints of Matilda's 95% CLT-based confidence interval can
actually help us to determine the endpoints of her 86% bootstrapped
confidence interval. You may also need to know the following facts:

-   `stats.norm.cdf(1.1)` evaluates to `0.86`

-   `stats.norm.cdf(1.5)` evaluates to `0.93`

Estimate the value of `cash_left` to one decimal place.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 19.8

The useful fact here is the second fact. It says that if you step 1.5 standard deviations to the right of the mean in a normal distribution, 93% of the area will be to the left. Since that leaves 7% of the area to the right, this also means that the area to the left of -1.5 standard units is 7%, by symmetry. So the area between -1.5 and 1.5 standard units is 86% of the area, or the bounds for an 86% confidence interval. This is the grey area in the picture below.

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/solution4_3.png' width=500></center>

The middle of our interval is 20.58 so we calculate the left endpoint as:

\begin{align*}
\texttt{cash\_left} &= 20.58 - 1.5 * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}\\
&= 20.58 - 1.5 * \frac{10}{\sqrt{400}}\\
&= 20.58 - 0.75 \\
&= 19.83\\
&\approx 19.8
\end{align*}

<average>22</average>

Which of the following are valid conclusions? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] Approximately 95% of the values in `cash_means` fall within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] Approximately 95% of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza have a price that falls within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] The actual mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza has a 95% chance of falling within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  Approximately 95% of the values in `cash_means` fall within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.

Choice 1 is correct because of the way bootstrapped confidence intervals are created. If we made a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval from `cash_means`, it would capture $95%$ of the values in `cash_means`, by design. This is not how the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$ was created, however; this interval comes from the CLT. However bootstrapped and CLT-based confidence intervals give very nearly the same results. They are two methods to solve the same problem and they create nearly identical confidence intervals. So it is correct to say that approximately 95% of the values in `cash_means` fall within a 95% CLT-based confidence interval, which is $[19.58, 21.58]$.

Choice 2 is incorrect because the interval estimates the mean price, not individual book prices.

Choice 3 is incorrect because confidence intervals are about the reliability of the method: if we repeated the whole bootstrapping process many times, about $95%$ of the intervals would contain the true mean. It does not indicate the probability of the true mean being within this specific interval because this interval is fixed and the true mean is also fixed. It doesn't make sense to talk about the probability of a fixed number falling in a fixed interval; that's like asking if there's a 95% chance that 5 is between 2 and 10.

Matilda has been wondering whether the mean price of books purchased
with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is $\$20$. What can she conclude about
this?

( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza could plausibly be $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is not $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is most likely not $20.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza could plausibly be $20.

This question is referring to a hypothesis test where we test whether parameter (in this case, the mean price of books purchased with cash) is equal to a specific value ($20). The hypothesis test can be conducted by constructing a confidence interval for the parameter and checking whether the specific value falls in the interval.  Since $20 is within the confidence interval, it is a plausible value for the parameter, but never guaranteed.
