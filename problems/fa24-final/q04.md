# BEGIN PROB

Matilda has been working at Bill's Book Bonanza since it
first opened and her shifts for each week are always randomly scheduled
(i.e., she does not work the same shifts each week). Due to the system
restrictions at the bookstore, when Matilda logs in with her employee
ID, she only has access to the history of sales made during her shifts.
Suppose these transactions are stored in a DataFrame called `matilda`,
which has the same columns as the `sales` DataFrame that stores all
transactions.

Matilda wants to use her random sample to estimate **the mean price of
books purchased with cash** at Bill's Book Bonanza. For the purposes of
this question, assume Matilda only has access to `matilda`, and not all
of `sales`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Complete the code below so that `cash_left` and `cash_right` store the
endpoints of an $86\%$ bootstrapped confidence interval for the mean
price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza.

        cash_means = np.array([])
        original = __(a)__
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            resample = original.sample(__(b)__)
            cash_means = np.append(cash_means, __(c)__)

        cash_left = __(d)__
        cash_right = __(e)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a) `matilda[matilda.get("cash")]`

<average>65</average>

(b) `original.shape[0], replace = True`

<average>79</average>

(c) `resample.get("price").mean()`

<average>71</average>

(d) `np.percentile(cash_means, 7)`

<average>84</average>

(e) `np.percentile(cash_means, 93)`

<average>84</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Next, Matilda uses the data in `matilda` to construct a $95\%$ CLT-based
confidence interval for the same parameter.

Given that there are 400 cash transactions in `matilda` and her
confidence interval comes out as $[19.58, 21.58]$, what is the standard
deviation of the prices of all cash transactions at Bill's Book Bonanza?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 10

$Width = 21.58 - 19.58 = 2$

$Width = 4 * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{400}}$

$SD = 2 * \frac{\sqrt{400}}{4} = 10$

<average>61</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Knowing the endpoints of Matilda's 95% CLT-based confidence interval can
actually help us to determine the endpoints of her 86% bootstrapped
confidence interval. You may also need to know the following facts:

-   `stats.norm.cdf(1.1)` evaluates to `0.86`

-   `stats.norm.cdf(1.5)` evaluates to `0.93`

Estimate the value of `cash_left` to one decimal place.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 19.8

given that we know 1.5 creates a 93% CDF, this must mean when also including the other bound of -1.5, it will create a 86% CI


$cash \_ left = middle - 1.5 * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$

$cash \_ left = middle - 1.5 * \frac{10}{\sqrt{400}}$

$cash \_ left = 20.58 - 0.75 = 19.8$

<average>22</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following are valid conclusions? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] Approximately 95% of the values in `cash_means` fall within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] Approximately 95% of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza have a price that falls within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] The actual mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza has a 95% chance of falling within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  Approximately 95% of the values in `cash_means` fall within the interval $[19.58, 21.58]$.

<average>63</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Matilda has been wondering whether the mean price of books purchased
with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is $\$20$. What can she conclude about
this?

( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza could plausibly be $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is not $20.
( ) The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza is most likely not $20.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**  The mean price of books purchased with cash at Bill's Book Bonanza could plausibly be $20

Since $20 is within the confidence interval (CI), it is plausible but not necessarily guaranteed 

<average>90</average>
