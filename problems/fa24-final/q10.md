Suppose the `bookstore` DataFrame has $10$ unique genres, and we are
given a sample of $350$ books from that DataFrame. Determine the maximum
possible total variation distance (TVD) that could occur between our
sample's genre distribution and the uniform distribution where each
genre occurs with equal probability. Your answer should be a single
number.

True or False: If the sample instead had 700 books, then the maximum
possible TVD would **increase**.

True or False: If the `bookstore` DataFrame had 11 genres instead of 10,
the maximum possible TVD would **increase**.
