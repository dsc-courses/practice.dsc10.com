Suppose the `bookstore` DataFrame has $10$ unique genres, and we are
given a sample of $350$ books from that DataFrame. Determine the maximum
possible total variation distance (TVD) that could occur between our
sample's genre distribution and the uniform distribution where each
genre occurs with equal probability. Your answer should be a single
number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

 **Answer**: 0.9

 To determine the maximum possible TVD, we consider the scenario where all books belong to a single genre. This represents the maximum deviation from the uniform distribution:

- **Uniform distribution:** $0.1$ probability for all genres
- **Single genre distribution:** $1$ probability for one genre and $0$ probability for all others

$$ 
TVD = \frac{1}{2} \left( |1 - 0.1| + 9 \times |0 - 0.1| \right) = \frac{1}{2} (0.9 + 0.9) = 0.9 
$$

True or False: If the sample instead had 700 books, then the maximum
possible TVD would **increase**.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

The maximum possible TVD is based on proportions and not absolute counts. Even if the sample size is increased, the TVD would remain the same.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: If the `bookstore` DataFrame had 11 genres instead of 10,
the maximum possible TVD would **increase**.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** True

With 11 genres, the uniform probability per genre decreases to $\frac{1}{11}$ instead of $\frac{1}{10}$ with 10 genres. In the extreme scenario where one genre dominates, the TVD is now bigger.

$$
TVD = \frac{1}{2} \left( |1 - \frac{1}{11}| + 10 \times |0 - \frac{1}{11}| \right) = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{10}{11} + \frac{10}{11}) = \frac{10}{11} 
$$
