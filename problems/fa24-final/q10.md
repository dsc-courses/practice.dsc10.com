Suppose the `bookstore` DataFrame has $10$ unique genres, and we are
given a sample of $350$ books from that DataFrame. Determine the maximum
possible total variation distance (TVD) that could occur between our
sample's genre distribution and the uniform distribution where each
genre occurs with equal probability. Your answer should be a single
number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

 **Answer**: 0.9

 To determine the maximum possible TVD, we consider the scenario where all books belong to a single genre. This represents the maximum deviation from the uniform distribution:

- **Uniform distribution probability per genre:** $0.1$ (or 10%)
- **Extreme case distribution:** $1$ for one genre and $0$ for all others

$$ 
TVD = \frac{1}{2} \left( |1 - 0.1| + 9 \times |0 - 0.1| \right) = \frac{1}{2} (0.9 + 0.9) = 0.9 
$$

True or False: If the sample instead had 700 books, then the maximum
possible TVD would **increase**.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

The maximum possible TVD is based on proportions and not absolute counts. Even if the sample size is increased, the proportions of maximum skew (one genre dominating completely) do not change. Thus, the TVD remains the same.

True or False: If the `bookstore` DataFrame had 11 genres instead of 10,
the maximum possible TVD would **increase**.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** True

With 11 genres, the uniform probability per genre decreases to about $0.0909$ from $0.1$ with 10 genres. In the most skewed scenario (one genre dominates):

$$
TVD = \frac{1}{2} \left( |1 - 0.0909| + 10 \times |0 - 0.0909| \right) = \frac{1}{2} (0.9091 + 0.9091) = 0.9091 
$$
