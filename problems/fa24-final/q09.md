# BEGIN PROB

\[(18 pts)\] As in the previous problem, suppose we are told that
`sales` contains 1000 rows, 500 of which represent cash transactions and
500 of which represent non-cash transactions.

This time, instead of being given histograms, we are told that the
distribution of `"price"` for cash transactions is roughly normal, with
a mean of $\$14$ and a standard deviation of $\$2$. We'll call this
distribution the cash curve.

Additionally, the distribution of `"price"` for non-cash transactions is
roughly normal, with a mean of $\$22$ and a standard deviation of $\$4$.
We'll call this distribution the non-cash curve.

We want to draw a curve representing the approximate distribution of
`"price"` for all transactions combined. We'll call this distribution
the combined curve.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the approximate proportion of area under the **cash curve**
between $\$10$ and $\$12$? Your answer should be a number between 0 and
1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the expression evaluates to
the approximate proportion of area under the **cash curve** between
$\$14.50$ and $\$17.50$. Each answer should be a single number.

    scipy.stats.norm.cdf(a) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(b)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Will the combined curve be roughly normal?

( ) Yes, because of the Central Limit Theorem.
( ) Yes, because combining two normal distributions always produces a
normal distri-\
bution.
( ) No, not necessarily.
