As in the previous problem, suppose we are told that
`sales` contains 1000 rows, 500 of which represent cash transactions and
500 of which represent non-cash transactions.

This time, instead of being given histograms, we are told that the
distribution of `"price"` for cash transactions is roughly normal, with
a mean of $\$14$ and a standard deviation of $\$2$. We'll call this
distribution the cash curve.

Additionally, the distribution of `"price"` for non-cash transactions is
roughly normal, with a mean of $\$22$ and a standard deviation of $\$4$.
We'll call this distribution the non-cash curve.

We want to draw a curve representing the approximate distribution of
`"price"` for all transactions combined. We'll call this distribution
the combined curve.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the approximate proportion of area under the **cash curve**
between $\$10$ and $\$12$? Your answer should be a number between 0 and
1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.135

The Empirical Rule tells us:

- **68% of the data** is found within one standard deviation (±1$\sigma$) of the mean.
- **95% of the data** falls within two standard deviations (±2$\sigma$).
- **99.7% of the data** lies within three standard deviations (±3$\sigma$).

Given mean is $14 and Standard Deviation is $2, using the empirical rule:

- The range from $12 to $16 (14 ± 2) covers one standard deviation from the mean, containing approximately 68% of the data. So range from $12 to $14 covers 34% of area.
- The range from $10 to $18 (14 ± 2*2)covers two standard deviation from the mean, containing approximately 95% of the data. So range from $10 to $14 covers 47.5% of area.

Area from $10 to $12 = Area from $10 to $14 - Area from $12 to $14 = 47.5% - 34% = 13.5% = 0.135

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the expression evaluates to
the approximate proportion of area under the **cash curve** between
$\$14.50$ and $\$17.50$. Each answer should be a single number.

    scipy.stats.norm.cdf(a) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(b)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a). **Answer**: 1.75

(b). **Answer**: 0.25

The expression `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(a) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(b)` calculates the area under the normal distribution curve between two points.
`a` and `b` represent the standardized values (or Z-scores) corresponding to $17.50 and $14.50, respectively.

Z-score is calculated using the formula: 

$$Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}$$

where:

- $X$ is the value for which we are calculating the Z-score.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

For $a$ corresponding to $17.50:

$$Z_a = \frac{(17.50 - 14)}{2} = 1.75$$

For $b$ corresponding to $14.50:

$$Z_b = \frac{(14.50 - 14)}{2} = 0.25$$

Will the combined curve be roughly normal?

( ) Yes, because of the Central Limit Theorem.
( ) Yes, because combining two normal distributions always produces a
normal distribution.
( ) No, not necessarily.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No, not necessarily.

Although both distributions are roughly normal, their means are significantly apart-one centered at 14 (with a standard deviation of 2) and one centered at 22 (with a standard deviation of 4)-the resulting distribution is likely bimodal. The combined distribution will have peaks near each of the original means, reflecting the characteristics of the two separate normal distributions.

The CLT says that “the distribution of possible sample means is approximately normal, no matter the distribution of the population,” but doesn't say anything about combining two distributions.

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the expression evaluates to

    (scipy.stats.norm.cdf(a) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(b)) / 2

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a). **Answer**: 4

(b). **Answer**: -2

Since the the **combined curve** is a combination of two normal distributions, each representing equal number of transactions (500 each), we can approximate the total area by averaging the areas under the individual cash and non-cash curves between $\$14$ and $\$22$.

1. For cash:

   $P(Z ≤ \frac{22-14}{2}) - P(Z ≤ \frac{14-14}{2})$

   $P(Z ≤ 4) - P(Z ≤ 0) =$ scipy.stats.norm.cdf(4) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0)

2. Non-cash:

   $P(Z ≤ \frac{22-22}{4}) - P(Z ≤ \frac{14-22}{4})$

   $P(Z ≤ 0) - P(Z ≤ -2) =$ scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2)

Averaging area under the two distributions:

$\frac{1}{2}$ (scipy.stats.norm.cdf(4) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0) + scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2)) = **scipy.stats.norm.cdf(4) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2) / 2**

What is the approximate proportion of area under the **combined curve**
between $\$14$ and $\$22$? Choose the closest answer below.

( ) 0.47 
( ) 0.49 
( ) 0.5 
( ) 0.95 
( ) 0.97

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.49

We can approximate the total area by averaging the areas under the individual cash and non-cash curves between $\$14$ and $\$22$.

1. For cash: mean = $14, SD = $2.
   - $22 is 4 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of $14.
   - Half the area from the mean to 4 SDs in a normal distribution is approximately 50%.

2. Non-cash: mean = $22, SD = $4.
   - $14 is 2 SD below the mean of $22.
   - The area 2 SD from mean is 95%, so the area from $14 to the mean (22) is half of 95%: 47.5%.

Averaging the two individual areas: $\frac{0.5 + 0.475}{2} = 0.4875$, which is closest to 0.49
