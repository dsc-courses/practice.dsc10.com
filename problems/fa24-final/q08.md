Suppose we are told that `sales` contains 1000 rows, 500 of
which represent cash transactions and 500 of which represent non-cash
transactions. We are given two density histograms representing the
distribution of `"price"` separately for the cash and non-cash
transactions.

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/non-cash.png' width=800></center>

From these two histograms, we'd like to create a single combined
histogram that shows the overall distribution of `"price"` for all 1000
rows in `sales`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many cash transactions had a `"price"` of $\$26$ or more?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 55

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/8_1_cash_above_26.png' width=800></center>

We first locate the bars representing $\$26$ or more on the cash transaction histogram, which are the three rightmost bars. We then calculate the area of these bars to get the proportion of cash transactions these bars correspond to. 

$$\textit{Area} = 0.03 * 2 + 0.02 * 2 + 0.005 * 2 = 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.11$$

Lastly, we multiply this proportion by the total count of 500 to get the count of transactions with a `"price"` of $\$26$ or more.

$$\text{number of transactions} = 0.11 * 500 = 55$$

Say our combined histogram has a bin $[4, 6)$. What will the height of
this bar be in the combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select
"Not enough information."

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Not enough information.

Since the histogram for non-cash transactions only has a bin of $[4, 8)$, we don't have enough information about how many of these transactions fall within $[4, 6)$. In general, we can't tell where within a bin values fall in a histogram.

Say our combined histogram has a bin $[24, 28)$. What will the height of
this bar be in the combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select
"Not enough information."

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.03

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/8_3_non_cash.png' width=800></center>

We first calculate the counts for cash and non-cash transactions within $[24, 28)$ separately. Then we add the two counts and find the proportion this represents out of 1000 total transactions. Lastly, we determine the height of the bar by dividing the area (proportion) by the width $4$.

Number of cash transactions within $[24, 28) = (0.05 * 2 + 0.03 * 2) * 500 = (0.1 + 0.06) * 500 = 0.16 * 500 = 80$

Number of non-cash transactions within $[24, 28) = (0.02 * 4) * 500 = 0.08 * 500 = 40$

Total number of transactions within $[24, 28) = 80 + 40 = 120$

Proportion of one thousand total transactions (area of bar) $= 120 / 1000 = 0.12$

Height of bar $= 0.12 / 4 = 0.03$

<average>42</average>

Suppose now that the histograms for cash and non-cash transactions are
the same as pictured, but they now represent 600 cash transactions and
400 non-cash transactions. In this situation, say our combined histogram
has a bin $[12, 16)$. What will the height of this bar be in the
combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select "Not enough
information."

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.04

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/8_4_non_cash.png' width=800></center>

We can use the same process as we used for the previous part. We first calculate the counts for cash and non-cash transactions within $[12, 16)$ separately. Then we add the two counts and find the proportion this represents out of 1000 total transactions. Lastly, we determine the height of the bar by dividing the area (proportion) by the width $4$.

Number of cash transactions within $[12, 16) = (0.06 * 2 + 0.04 * 2) * 600 = (0.12 + 0.08) * 600 = 0.2 * 600 = 120$

Number of non-cash transactions within $[12, 16) = (0.025 * 4) * 400 = 0.1 * 400 = 40$

Total number of transactions within $[12, 16) = 120 + 40 = 160$

Proportion of one thousand total transactions (area of bar) $= 160 / 1000 = 0.16$

Height of bar $= 0.16 / 4 = 0.04$
