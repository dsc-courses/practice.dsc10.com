Suppose we are told that `sales` contains 1000 rows, 500 of
which represent cash transactions and 500 of which represent non-cash
transactions. We are given two density histograms representing the
distribution of `"price"` separately for the cash and non-cash
transactions.

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa24-final/non-cash.png' width=800></center>

From these two histograms, we'd like to create a single combined
histogram that shows the overall distribution of `"price"` for all 1000
rows in `sales`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many cash transactions had a `"price"` of $\$26$ or more?

Say our combined histogram has a bin $[4, 6)$. What will the height of
this bar be in the combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select
"Not enough information.\"

Say our combined histogram has a bin $[24, 28)$. What will the height of
this bar be in the combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select
"Not enough information.\"

Suppose now that the histograms for cash and non-cash transactions are
the same as pictured, but they now represent 600 cash transactions and
400 non-cash transactions. In this situation, say our combined histogram
has a bin $[12, 16)$. What will the height of this bar be in the
combined histogram? Fill in the answer box or select "Not enough
information.\"
