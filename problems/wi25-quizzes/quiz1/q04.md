# BEGIN PROB

The Data Science Student Society has a `$500` budget, which they will
use only to buy food for their 4 meetings this quarter. Each time they
have a meeting, they will use exactly half of their remaining budget on
food. For example, the first meeting's food cost will be `$250` and the
next meeting's food cost will be `$125`. Use `np.arange()`, together
with arithmetic operations, to assign `food_costs` to an array
containing the food cost for each of the 4 meetings. **Do not** use
`np.array()`.

`food_costs = `

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 
`500 * 0.5 ** np.arange(1,5)`
or 
`500/2 ** np.arange(1,5)`

<average>11</average>
