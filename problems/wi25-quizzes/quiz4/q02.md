# BEGIN PROB

A researcher collects data on many flowers, some of which have been
treated with fertilizer and some of which have not (untreated). The
researcher wants to determine whether there is a relationship between
fertilizer use and the height of the flowers.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Choose the correct formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses.

( ) **Null**: There is a difference in the average height of treated and untreated flowers.\ **Alt:** There is no difference in the average height of treated and untreated flowers.
( ) **Null:** There is no difference in the average height of treated and untreated flowers.\ **Alt**: There is a difference in the average height of treated and untreated flowers.\
( ) **Null**: There is no difference in the average height of treated and untreated flowers.\ **Alt:** Treated flowers grow taller,on average, than untreated flowers.
( ) **Null**: Fertilizer use has no impact on flower height.\ **Alt:** Fertilizer use causes taller flowers.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** B

<average>70</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: We could use a permutation test to test these hypotheses.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** True

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# END PROB
