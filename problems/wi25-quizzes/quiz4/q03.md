The DataFrame `flowers` contains information on a sample of flower
fields. Each row corresponds to a different flower field. The
`"Fertilizer"` column contains Boolean values corresponding to whether
each flower field uses fertilizer.

You wonder if it could be the case that flower fields are fertilized at
random, with each flower field having an 80% chance of being fertilized,
independently of all others. You decide to do a hypothesis test to
determine whether this could or could not be the case, testing at the
$p=0.05$ significance level. You will use as your test statistic **the
absolute difference between 0.8 and the proportion of fertilized flower
fields**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Complete the implementation of the function `one_stat`, which calculates
one simulated value of this test statistic, under the assumptions of the
null hypothesis. Note that the optional argument `p` in
`np.random.choice` specifies the probabilities with which each element
is chosen (here, there is a 0.8 probability of selecting `True`).

    def one_stat():
        sample_size = __(a)__
        random_choice = (np.random.choice([True, False], 
                         sample_size, p=[0.8, 0.2]))
        return __(b)__


# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `flowers.shape[0]` \
`(b)`: `abs(random_choice.sum() / sample_size - 0.8)`

<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Complete the implementation of the function `one_stat_differently`,
which also calculates one simulated value of this test statistic under
the null.

    def one_stat_differently():
        multi = np.random.multinomial(__(c)__)
        return __(d)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(c)`: `flowers.shape[0], [0.8, 0.2]` \
`(d)`: `abs(multi[0] / flowers.shape[0] - 0.8)`

<average>65</average>

Fill in the blanks to calculate 10,000 simulated values of the test
statistic and collect them in an array called `many_stats`. You can use
the functions you've already written to help you.

            many_stats = __(e)__
            for i in np.arange(10000):
                many_stats = __(f)__


# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(e)`: `np.array([])` \
`(f)`: `np.append(many_stats, one_stat())`

<average>75</average>

Suppose that the observed value of the test statistic is 0.04. What do
we conclude?

( ) Reject the null hypothesis. 
( ) Accept the null hypothesis.
( ) Fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
( ) Not enough information.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Not enough information.

<average>15</average>

True or False: We could construct a confidence interval to test these
hypotheses.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: True
