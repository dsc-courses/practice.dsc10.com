You want to estimate the proportion of all flower fields in the world
that use fertilizer. You will create a **68% confidence interval** for
this proportion, based on a sample of flower fields. You want your
confidence interval to have a width of **at most 0.01**. Using the fact
that the standard deviation of any dataset of 0s and 1s is no more than
0.5, calculate the **minimum sample size required**. Give your answer as
an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
