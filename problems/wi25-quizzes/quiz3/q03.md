# BEGIN PROB

Your friend at SDSU records the number of students who visit their library each day, for $100$ days. They tell you that the average is
$6{,}000$ and that the standard deviation is $500$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Without knowing anything about the distribution of your friend's data, find the endpoints of the smallest interval which is guaranteed to
contain at least $75\%$ of your friend's data. Both endpoints should be
given as **integers**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $[5000, 7000]$

<average>64</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

If you then learn that your friend's data is normally distributed, approximately what percentage of the data is actually contained in the interval you found above? Give your answer as an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $95\%$

<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
