UCSD uses a system called EASy for students to submit requests for
enrollment if they need an exception to the enrollment requirements.
Naturally, bigger classes generally receive more EASy requests.

Suppose the average number of seats per class ($x$) is $75$, with a
standard deviation of $25$, and the average number of EASy requests per
class ($y$) is $10$, with a standard deviation of $4$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

For this subpart only, suppose the correlation between $x$ and $y$ is 0.5. Use the regression
line to predict the number of EASy requests for a class with 100 seats. Give your answer
as an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 12

<average>67</average>

A Japanese class has 150 seats and receives 16 EASy requests. Say we use linear
regression to predict the number of EASy requests from the number of seats, and find
that the **squared** residual for this Japanese class is 4. What is the **smallest** possible
correlation between $x$ and $y$ in this case? Give your answer as a **simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 1/3

<average>36</average>
