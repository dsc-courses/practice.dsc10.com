# BEGIN PROB

UCSD is testing whether a new version of the TritonLink website will
improve student engagement. Each student who visits the Tritonlink
website receives either the old version or the new version at random,
and the number of minutes spent on the site is recorded.

The results of the experiment are stored in the DataFrame `tritonlink`,
whose first few rows are shown at right.

Let's do a permutation test with the following hypotheses:

**Null Hypothesis:** The amount of time students spend on the TritonLink
website is **the same for both versions** of the website.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Students spend **more time on the new version** of the site.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

For our test statistic, we'll use the mean time spent on the new version
of the site minus the mean time spent on the old version of the site.
The function below should compute one simulated difference of this
statistic under the null hypothesis.

    def one_stat():
        shuffled = np.random.permutation(__(a)__)
        shuffled_df = tritonlink.assign(shuffled = shuffled)
        grouped = shuffled_df.groupby(__(b)__).mean().get("minutes")
        return __(c)__

\(i\) Which of the following statements about blank `(a)` is correct?

( ) We can shuffle either `"minutes"` or `"version"` because it doesn't matter which column we shuffle in a permutation test.
( ) We must shuffle `"minutes"` because only numerical data can be shuffled in a permutation test.
( ) We must shuffle `"version"` because only group labels can be shuffled in a permutation test.
( ) We must shuffle `"minutes"` because of the structure of the provided code.
( ) We must shuffle `"version"` because of the structure of the provided code.

\(ii\) Fill in blanks `(b)` and `(c)` below.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

\(i\): Option E

\(ii\): \
`(b)`: `"shuffled"` \
`(c)`: `grouped.loc["new"] - grouped.loc["old"]`

<average>61</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we complete our permutation test and calculate a p-value. Which
of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

[ ] If the p-value is $0.18$, this means that if the alternative hypothesis is true, the probability of seeing a difference as or more extreme as the observed difference is about $18\%$.
[ ] If the p-value is $0.03$, this means that if the null hypothesis is true, the probability of seeing a difference as or more extreme as the observed difference is about $3\%$.
[ ] If the p-value is $0$, this means that we implemented our permutation test incorrectly.
[ ] If the p-value is $0.5$, this means that exactly half of the simulated test statistics were less extreme than our observed difference.
[ ] None of the above.

**Answer**: Options 2 and 4
