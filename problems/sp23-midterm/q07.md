# BEGIN PROB

The four most common majors among students in DSC 10 this quarter are
`"MA30"` (Mathematics - Computer Science), `"EN30"` (Business
Economics), `"EN25"` (Economics), and `"CG35"` (Cognitive Science with a
Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation). We'll call
these four majors "popular majors\".

There are 80 students in DSC 10 with a popular major. The distribution
of popular majors is given in the bar chart below.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank below so that the expression outputs the bar chart
above.

```py
    (survey
     .groupby('Major').count()
     .sort_values('College')
     .take(____)
     .get('Section')
     .plot(kind='barh')
    )
```

What goes in the blank?

`"CG35"` major?
