The four most common majors among students in DSC 10 this quarter are
`"MA30"` (Mathematics - Computer Science), `"EN30"` (Business
Economics), `"EN25"` (Economics), and `"CG35"` (Cognitive Science with a
Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation). We'll call
these four majors "popular majors\".

There are 80 students in DSC 10 with a popular major. The distribution
of popular majors is given in the bar chart below.
