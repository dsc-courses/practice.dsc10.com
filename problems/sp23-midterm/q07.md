The four most common majors among students in DSC 10 this quarter are
`"MA30"` (Mathematics - Computer Science), `"EN30"` (Business
Economics), `"EN25"` (Economics), and `"CG35"` (Cognitive Science with a
Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation). We'll call
these four majors "popular majors\".

There are 80 students in DSC 10 with a popular major. The distribution
of popular majors is given in the bar chart below.

Fill in the blank below so that the expression outputs the bar chart
above.

```py
    (survey
     .groupby("Major").count()
     .sort_values("College")
     .take(____)
     .get("Section")
     .plot(kind="barh")
    )
```

What goes in the blank?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `[-4, -3. -2, -1]`

Let's break down the code line by line:

- `.groupby("Major")` will group the survey DataFrame by the `"Major"` column.
- `.count()` will count the number of students in each major.
- `.sort_values("College")` sort these counts in ascending order using the `"College"` column (which now contains counts).
- `.take([-4, -3. -2, -1])` will take the last 4 rows of the DataFrame, which will correspond to the 4 most common majors.
- `.get("Section")` get the `"Section"` column, which also contains counts.
- `.plot(kind="barh")` will plot these counts in a horizontal bar chart.

The argument we give to `take` is `[-4, -3, -2, -1]`, because that will give us back a DataFrame corresponding to the counts of the 4 most common majors, with the most common major (`"MA30"`) at the bottom. We want the most common major at the bottom of the Series that `.plot(kind="barh")` is called on because the bottom row will correspond to the top bar â€“ remember, `kind="barh"` plots one bar per row, but in reverse order.

Suppose we select **two** students in popular majors at random with
replacement. What is the probability that both have `"EN"` in their
major code? Give your answer in the form of a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{1}{4}$

- Total number of students in popular majors: $30 + 25 + 15 + 10 = 80$
- The number of students with `"EN"` in their major code is the sum of `"EN30"` and `"EN25"` students: $25 + 15 = 40$

The probability that a single student chosen at random from the popular majors has `"EN"` in their major code is number of `"EN"` majors divided by total number of popular majors.

$$P(\text{one has ``EN"}) = \frac{40}{80} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Since the students are chosen with replacement, the probabilities remain consistent for each draw. So the probability that both randomly chosen students (with replacement) have `"EN"` in their major code is

$$P(\text{both have ``EN"}) = P(\text{one has ``EN"}) \cdot P(\text{one has ``EN"}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$$

Suppose we select **two** students in popular majors at random with
replacement. What is the probability that we select one `"CG35"` major
and one `"MA30"` major (in any order)?

( ) $\frac{1}{2}$
( ) $\frac{3}{4}$
( ) $\frac{3}{8}$
( ) $\frac{3}{16}$
( ) $\frac{3}{32}$
( ) $\frac{3}{64}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{3}{32}$

- The probability of selecting one `"CG35"` major first and then one `"MA30"` major is:
$\frac{10}{80}$ $\cdot$ $\frac{30}{80}$ = $\frac{1}{8}$ $\cdot$ $\frac{3}{8}$ = $\frac{3}{64}$
- The probability of selecting one `"MA30"` major first and then one `"CG35"` major is:
$\frac{30}{80}$ $\cdot$ $\frac{10}{80}$ = $\frac{3}{8}$ $\cdot$ $\frac{1}{8}$ = $\frac{3}{64}$

Since the two events are mutually exclusive (they cannot both happen), we sum their probabilities to get the combined probability of the event occurring in any order:\
$$P(\text{one ``CG35" and one ``MA30"}) = P(\text{``CG35" then ``MA30" OR ``MA30" then ``CG35"}) = P(\text{``CG35 then ``MA30"}) + P(\text{``MA30" then ``CG35"}) = \frac{3}{64} + \frac{3}{64} = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32}$$

Suppose we select **$k$** students in popular majors at random with
replacement. What is the probability that we select at least one
`"CG35"` major?

( ) $\frac{7}{8}$ 
( ) $\frac{7^k}{8^k}$ 
( ) $\frac{1}{7^k}$ 
( ) $\frac{1}{8^k}$ 
( ) $\frac{8^k - 7^k}{7^k}$
( ) $\frac{8^k - 7^k}{8^k}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{8^k - 7^k}{8^k}$

Of the 80 students in popular majors, 10 are in `"CG35"`. To determine the likelihood of selecting at least one `"CG35"` major out of **$k$** random draws with replacement, we first find the probability of not drawing a `"CG35"` major in all **$k$** attempts by following the steps below:

- The probability of not selecting a `"CG35"` major in one draw is $1$ - $\frac{10}{80}$ = $1$ - $\frac{1}{8}$ = $\frac{7}{8}$

- The probability of not selecting a `"CG35"` major in **$k$** draws is, then, $\frac{7^k}{8^k}$, since each draw is independent.

Now, by subtracting this probability from 1, we get the probability of drawing at least one `"CG35"` major in those **$k$** attempts. So, the probability of selecting at least one `"CG35"` major in **$k$** attempts is $$1 - \frac{7^k}{8^k} = \frac{8^k}{8^k} - \frac{7^k}{8^k} = \frac{8^k - 7^k}{8^k}$$
