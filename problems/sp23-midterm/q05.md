# BEGIN PROB

Teresa and Sophia are bored while waiting in line at Bistro and decide
to start flipping a UCSD-themed coin, with a picture of King Triton's
face as the heads side and a picture of his mermaid-like tail as the
tails side.

Teresa flips the coin 21 times and sees 13 heads and 8 tails. She stores
this information in a DataFrame named `teresa` that has 21 rows and 2
columns, such that:

-   The `"flips"` column contains `"Heads"` 13 times and `"Tails"` 8
    times.

-   The `"Wolftown"` column contains `"Teresa"` 21 times.

Then, Sophia flips the coin 11 times and sees 4 heads and 7 tails. She
stores this information in a DataFrame named `sophia` that has 11 rows
and 2 columns, such that:

-   The `"flips"` column contains `"Heads"` 4 times and `"Tails"` 7
    times.

-   The `"Makai"` column contains `"Sophia"` 11 times.

How many rows are in the following DataFrame? Give your answer as an
integer.

```py
    teresa.merge(sophia, on="flips")
```

Let $A$ be your answer to the previous part. Now, suppose that:

-   `teresa` contains an additional row, whose `"flips"` value is
    `"Total"` and whose `"Wolftown"` value is 21.

-   `sophia` contains an additional row, whose `"flips"` value is
    `"Total"` and whose `"Makai"` value is 11.

Suppose we again merge `teresa` and `sophia` on the `"flips"` column. In
terms of $A$, how many rows are in the new merged DataFrame?

( ) $A$
( ) $A+1$
( ) $A+2$
( ) $A+4$
( ) $A+231$
