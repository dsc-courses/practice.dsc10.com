Suppose the height of a bar in the above histogram is $h$. How many
students are represented in the corresponding bin, in terms of $h$?

*Hint: Just as in the first subpart, you'll need to use the assumption
from the start of the problem.*

( ) $20 \cdot h$
( ) $100 \cdot h$
( ) $200 \cdot h$
( ) $400 \cdot h$
( ) $800 \cdot h$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $400 \cdot h$
