Fill in the blanks below so that the expression evaluates to the most
unread emails of any student that has 0 Instagram followers.

```py
survey[__(a)__].__(b)__
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `survey.get("IG Followers") == 0`

`survey.get("IG Followers")` is a Series containing the values in the `"IG Followers"` column. `survey.get("IG Followers") == 0`, then, is a Series of `True`s and `False`s, containing `True` for rows where the number of `"IG Followers"` is 0 and `False` for all other rows.

Put together, `survey[survey.get("IG Followers") == 0]` evaluates to a new DataFrame, which only has the rows in `survey` where the student's number of `"IG Followers"` is `0`.

What goes in blank (b)? Select all valid answers.

[ ] `get("Unread Emails").apply(max)`
[ ] `get("Unread Emails").max()`
[ ] `sort_values("Unread Emails", ascending=False).get("Unread Emails").iloc[0]`
[ ] `sort_values("Unread Emails", ascending=False).get("Unread Emails").iloc[-1]`
[ ] None of the above

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Options 2 and 3

Let's look at each option.

- **Option 1**: `get("Unread Emails").apply(max)` This option is invalid because `.apply(max)` will produce a new Series containing the maximums of each individual element in `"Unread Emails"` rather than the maximum of the entire column. Since the values in the `"Unread Emails"` columns are numbers, this will try to call `max` on a number individually (many times), and that errors, since e.g. `max(2)` is invalid.
- **Option 2**: `get("Unread Emails").max()` This option is valid because it directly fetches the `"Unread Emails"` column and uses the `max` method to retrieve the highest value within it, aligning with the goal of identifying the most unread emails.
- **Option 3**: `sort_values("Unread Emails", ascending=False).get("Unread Emails").iloc[0]` This option is valid. The `sort_values("Unread Emails", ascending=False)` method call sorts the `"Unread Emails"` column in descending order. Following this, `.get("Unread Emails")` retrieves the sorted column, and `.iloc[0]` selects the first element, which, given the sorting, represents the maximum number of unread emails.
- **Option 4**: `sort_values("Unread Emails", ascending=False).get("Unread Emails").iloc[-1]` This option is invalid because, although it sorts the `"Unread Emails"` column in descending order, it selects the last element with `.iloc[-1]`, which represents the smallest number of unread emails due to the descending sort order.

Now, consider the following block of code.

```py
temp = survey.groupby(["IG Followers", "College"]).max().reset_index()
revellian = temp[__(c)__].get("Unread Emails").__(d)__
```

Fill in the blanks below so that `revellian` is equal to the most unread
emails of any student in Revelle, among those with 0 Instagram
followers.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answers**: `(temp.get("College") == "Revelle") & (temp.get("IG Followers") == 0)`

To identify the students in `"Revelle"` with `0` Instagram followers, we filter the `temp` DataFrame using two conditions: `(temp["IG Followers"] == 0)` ensures students have no Instagram followers, and `(temp["College"] == "Revelle")` ensures the student is from `"Revelle"`. The `&` operator combines these conditions, resulting in a subset of students from `"Revelle"` with 0 Instagram followers.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `iloc[0]`, `iloc[-1]`, `sum()`, `max()`, `mean()`, or any other method that when called on a Series with a single value outputs that same value

To create `temp`, we grouped on both `"IG Followers"` and `"College"` and used the `max` aggregation method. This means that `temp` has exactly one row where `"College"` is `"Revelle"` and `"IG Followers"` is 0, since when we group on both `"IG Followers"` and `"College"`, the resulting DataFrame has exactly one row for every unique combination of `"IG Followers"` and `"College"` name. We've already identified that before blank (d) is

```py
temp[(temp.get("College") == "Revelle") & (temp.get("IG Followers") == 0)].get("Unread Emails")
```

Since `temp[(temp.get("College") == "Revelle") & (temp.get("IG Followers") == 0)]` is a DataFrame with just a single row, the entire expression is a Series with just a single value, being the maximum value we ever saw in the `"Unread Emails"` column when `"College"` was `"Revelle"` and `"IG Followers"` was 0. To extract the one element out of a Series that only has one element, we can use many aggregation methods (`max`, `min`, `mean`, `median`) or use `.iloc[0]` or `.iloc[-1]`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The student in Revelle with the most unread emails, among those with 0
Instagram followers, is a `"HI25"` (History) major.
Is the value `"HI25"` guaranteed to appear at least once within
`temp.get("Major")`?

( ) Yes
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No

When the `survey` DataFrame is grouped by both `"IG Followers"` and `"College"` using the `.max` aggregation method, it retrieves the maximum value for each column based on alphabetical order. Even if a student in `"Revelle"` with 0 Instagram followers has the most unread emails and is a `"HI25"` major, the `"HI25"` value would only be the maximum for the `"Major"` column if no other major code in the same group alphabetically surpasses it. Therefore, if there's another major code like `"HI26"` or `"MA30"` in that group, it would be chosen as the maximum instead of `"HI25"`.
