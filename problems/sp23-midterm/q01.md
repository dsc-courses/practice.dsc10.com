What **value** does the following expression evaluate to? If you believe
the expression errors, provide a one sentence explanation of why.

For example, if you think the expression evaluates to an int, don't
write "int\" or "the largest value in the `"IG Followers"` column\",
write the specific int, like "23\".

*Hint: You have enough information to answer the problem; don't forget
to look at the data description page.*

```py
(survey
.sort_values(by="Class Standing")
.groupby("College").count()
.get("IG Followers")
.index[0]
)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: "ERC"

Consider again the expression from part (e). Suppose we remove the piece

```py
.sort_values(by="Class Standing")
```

but keep all other parts the same. Does this change the value the
expression evaluates to?

( ) Yes, this changes the value the expression evaluates to.
( ) No, this does not change the value the expression evaluates to.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No, this does not change the value the expression evaluates to.

 .loc[0]

```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The code errors, since the index after grouping there is no `College` named 0.
