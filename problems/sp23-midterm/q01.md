What is the type of the following expression?

```py

 .sort_values(by="Class Standing")
)
```

( ) int or float       
( ) list or array    
( ) Boolean
( ) Series
( ) string
( ) DataFrame  

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: DataFrame

Test

The method `sort_values(by="Class Standing")` sorts the DataFrame by the `"Class Standing"` column and returns a new DataFrame, without modifying the original one. The resulting DataFrame will be sorted by class standing in ascending order unless specified otherwise by providing the `ascending=False` argument.

What is the type of the following expression?

```

( ) int or float       
( ) list or array    
( ) Boolean
( ) Series
( ) string
( ) DataFrame      

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: DataFrame

The method `sort_values(by="Class Standing")` sorts the **survey** DataFrame based on the entries in the `"Class Standing"` column, producing a new DataFrame sorted per the specified column. Following this, `groupby("College")` organizes the sorted DataFrame by grouping entries using the `"College"` column. Subsequently, applying `.count()` computes the number of non-null values for each column within each group. The final output, after employing `.count()`, is a DataFrame where the indices are the distinct entries from the `"College"` grouping column, and the corresponding column values depict the counts of non-null entries.

 # BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Series

The method `sort_values(by="Class Standing")` sorts the **survey** DataFrame according to the `"Class Standing"` column, yielding a new DataFrame arranged by the specified column. Next, `groupby("College")` organizes the sorted DataFrame, grouping entries based on the `"College"` column. Following that, `.count()` determines the number of non-null entries for each column within each group. Subsequent to utilizing `.count()`, the result is a DataFrame where the indices are unique entries from the `"College"` column, and the column values illustrate counts of non-null entries. Lastly, `.get("IG Followers")` retrieves the column labeled `"IG Followers"` from the resulting DataFrame. Therefore, the type of the entire expression is a Series since retrieving a single column from a DataFrame yields a Series.

What is the type of the following expression?

( ) int or float

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: int or float

Beginning with `sort_values(by="Class Standing")`, the **survey** DataFrame is sorted based on the `"Class Standing"` column, creating a newly sorted DataFrame according to that column. Subsequently, `groupby("College")` groups the sorted DataFrame using the `"College"` column, organizing entries accordingly. Then, `.count()` calculates the number of non-null entries for each column within each defined group. After utilizing `.count()`, we have a DataFrame where the indices are unique entries from the `"College"` column, and the associated column values denote counts of non-null entries. Moving forward, `.get("IG Followers")` selects the `"IG Followers"` column from the resulting DataFrame, resulting in a Pandas Series since extracting a single column from a DataFrame yields a Series. Lastly, `.iloc[0]` accesses the first element of the Series, which would be the non-null count of `"IG Followers"` for the first college (alphabetically) in the grouped data.

What **value** does the following expression evaluate to? If you believe
the expression errors, provide a one sentence explanation of why.

For example, if you think the expression evaluates to an int, don't
write "int\" or "the largest value in the `"IG Followers"` column\",
write the specific int, like "23\".

```py

.groupby("College").count()
.get("IG Followers")
.index[0]
)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `"ERC"`

The method `.sort_values(by="Class Standing")` sorts the survey DataFrame based on `"Class Standing"`, though this step does not influence the order of colleges. Following this, `.groupby("College")` groups the DataFrame according to the distinct college names, which are, by default, arranged in an alphanumeric order in the resulting grouped object. Applying `.count()` next, the function computes the non-null counts for each column within each group, presenting a DataFrame where the indices are the unique college names and the columns represent counts. After using `.get("IG Followers")`, a Series is obtained, using college names as indices and counts of `"IG Followers"` as values. The concluding step, `.index[0]`, retrieves the first index label from this Series. Given the mentioned college names: `"ERC"`, `"Marshall"`, `"Muir"`, `"Revelle"`, `"Seventh"`, `"Sixth"`, and `"Warren"`, the alphabetically first college, `"ERC"`, is expected to be the first index in the Series and, therefore, the resultant output of the expression.

Consider again the expression from 1.5. Suppose we remove the piece

```py
.sort_values(by="Class Standing")
```

but keep all other parts the same. Does this change the value the
expression evaluates to?

( ) Yes, this changes the value the expression evaluates to.
( ) No, this does not change the value the expression evaluates to.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: No, this does not change the value the expression evaluates to.

The removed part `.sort_values(by="Class Standing")` sorts the survey DataFrame based on the `"Class Standing"` column, but this action does not impact the subsequent grouping by `"College"`. Thus, when `.groupby("College")` is applied, it groups the data into subsets based on unique college names, and these groups are usually arranged alphanumerically by default, irrespective of the prior sorting. Therefore, despite omitting the sorting step, the groups still maintain the same order. After employing `.count()`, the function calculates non-null counts per column for each college group, and then `.get("IG Followers")` selects the `"IG Followers"` column, producing a Series with college names as indices and `"IG Followers"` counts as values. Lastly, `.index[0]` retrieves the first index label from the Series, which, due to the inherent alphanumeric ordering of the college names (`"ERC"`, `"Marshall"`, `"Muir"`, `"Revelle"`, `"Seventh"`, `"Sixth"`, and `"Warren"`), should still be `"ERC"`. Consequently, omitting the sorting step doesnâ€™t modify the final value that the expression evaluates to.

```py

 .loc[0]
)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The code produces an error because, after the grouping operation, the resulting Series uses the unique college names as indices, and there isn't a college named `0`.

In the context of the described operations, the expression (`survey .sort_values(by="Class Standing") .groupby("College").count() .get("IG Followers")`) yields a Series with the colleges as indices and non-null counts of `"IG Followers"` as the values. Here, when `.loc[0]` is used, it attempts to access an element with the label `0` from the Series. However, our indices are college names (strings: `"ERC"`, `"Marshall"`, `"Muir"`, `"Revelle"`, `"Seventh"`, `"Sixth"`, and `"Warren"`), not integer labels, leading to a KeyError as `0` is not among the labels in the Series' index. This discrepancy in expected and actual index labels prompts the error.
