\[(12 pts)\] Currently, the `"Section"` column of `survey` contains the
values `"A"` and `"B"`. However, it's more natural to think of the
lecture sections in terms of their times, i.e. `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`.

Below, we've defined four functions, named `converter_1`, `converter_2`,
`converter_3`, and `converter_4`. All four functions return `"12PM"`
when `"A"` is the argument passed in and return `"1PM"` when `"B"` is
the argument passed in. Where they potentially differ is in how they
behave when called on arguments other than `"A"` and `"B"`.

Note: In the answer choices below, by `None` we mean that the function
call doesn't return anything, but doesn't error either.

Suppose we decide to use `converter_4` to convert the values in the
`"Section"` column of `survey` to times. To do so, we first use the
`.apply` method, like so:

    section_times = survey.get("Section").apply(converter_4)

1.  What is the type of `section_times`?

      ------------------- -- --
      ( ) int or float       
      ( ) list or array      
      ------------------- -- --

2.  We'd then like to replace the `"Section"` column in `survey` with
    the results in `section_times`. To do so, we run the following line
    of code, after running the assignment statement above:

        survey.assign(Section="section_times")

    What is the result of running the above line of code?

    ( ) The `"Section"` column in `survey` now contains only the values
    `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`

    ( ) The line evaluates to a new DataFrame whose `"Section"` column
    only contains the values `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`, but the `"Section"`
    column in `survey` still contains the values `"A"` and `"B"`

    ( ) An error is raised, because we can't use `.assign` with a column
    name that already exists

    ( ) An error is raised, because the value after the `=` needs to be
    a list, array, or Series, not a string

    ( ) An error is raised, because the value before the `=` needs to be
    a string, not a variable name
