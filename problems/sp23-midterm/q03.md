# BEGIN PROB

Currently, the `"Section"` column of `survey` contains the
values `"A"` and `"B"`. However, it's more natural to think of the
lecture sections in terms of their times, i.e. `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`.

Below, we've defined four functions, named `converter_1`, `converter_2`,
`converter_3`, and `converter_4`. All four functions return `"12PM"`
when `"A"` is the argument passed in and return `"1PM"` when `"B"` is
the argument passed in. Where they potentially differ is in how they
behave when called on arguments other than `"A"` and `"B"`.

Note: In the answer choices below, by `None` we mean that the function
call doesn't return anything, but doesn't error either.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Consider the function `converter_1`, defined below.

```py
    def converter_1(section):
        if section == "A":
            return "12PM"
        else:
            return "1PM"
```

When `convert_1` is called on an argument other than `"A"` or `"B"`, what
does it return?

( ) `"12PM"`
( ) `"1PM"`
( ) `None`
( ) It errors

<br>

Consider the function `converter_2`, defined below.

```py
    def converter_2(section):
        time_dict = {
            "A": "12PM",
            "B": "1PM"
        }
        return times_dict[section]
```

When `convert_2` is called on an argument other than `"A"` or `"B"`, what does it return?

( ) `"12PM"`
( ) `"1PM"`
( ) `None`
( ) It errors

<br>

Consider the function `converter_3`, defined below.

```py
    def converter_3(section):
        if section == "A":
            return "12PM"
        elif section == "B":
            return "1PM"
        else:
            return 1 / 0
```

When converter_3 is called on an argument other than `"A"` or `"B"`, what does it return?

( ) `"12PM"`
( ) `"1PM"`
( ) `None`
( ) It errors

<br>

Consider the function `converter_4`, defined below.

```py
    def converter_4(section):
        sections = ["A", "B"]
        times = ["12PM", "1PM"]
        for i in range(len(sections)):
            if section == sections[i]:
                return times[i]
```
When `converter_4` is called on an argument other than `"A"` or `"B"`, what does it return?

( ) `"12PM"`
( ) `"1PM"`
( ) `None`
( ) It errors

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `converter_1`: `"1PM"`, `converter_2`: It errors, `converter_3`: It errors, `converter_4`: None

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we decide to use `converter_4` to convert the values in the
`"Section"` column of `survey` to times. To do so, we first use the
`.apply` method, like so:

```py
    section_times = survey.get("Section").apply(converter_4)
```

What is the type of `section_times`?

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean
( ) string
( ) list or array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame

<br>

We'd then like to replace the `"Section"` column in `survey` with
the results in `section_times`. To do so, we run the following line
of code, after running the assignment statement above:

```py
    survey.assign(Section="section_times")
```

What is the result of running the above line of code?

( ) The `"Section"` column in `survey` now contains only the values `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`.
( ) The line evaluates to a new DataFrame whose `"Section"` column only contains the values `"12PM"` and `"1PM"`, but the `"Section"` column in `survey` still contains the values `"A"` and `"B"`.
( ) An error is raised, because we can't use `.assign` with a column name that already exists.
( ) An error is raised, because the value after the `=` needs to be a list, array, or Series, not a string.
( ) An error is raised, because the value before the `=` needs to be a string, not a variable name.
