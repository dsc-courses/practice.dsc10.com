Consider the following block of code.

```py
    A = survey.shape[0]
    B = survey.groupby(["Unread Emails", "IG Followers"]).count().shape[0]
```

Suppose the expression `A == B` evaluates to `True`. Given this fact,
what can we conclude?

( ) There are no two students in the class with the same number of unread emails.
( ) There are no two students in the class with the same number of Instagram followers.
( ) There are no two students in the class with the same number of Instagram followers, and there are no two students in the class with the same number of unread emails.
( ) There are no two students in the class with both the same number of unread emails and the same number of Instagram followers.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: There are no two students in the class with both the same number of unread emails and the same number of Instagram followers.

We'd like to find the mean number of Instagram followers of all students
in DSC 10. One **correct** way to do so is given below.

```py
    mean_1 = survey.get("IG Followers").mean()
```

Another two **possible** ways to do this are given below.

```py
    # Possible method 1.
    mean_2 = survey.groupby("Section").mean().get("IG Followers").mean()

    # Possible method 2.
    X = survey.groupby("Section").sum().get("IG Followers").sum()
    Y = survey.groupby("Section").count().get("IG Followers").sum()
    mean_3 = X / Y
```
Is `mean_2` equal to `mean_1`?

( ) Yes.
( ) Yes, if both sections have the same number of students, otherwise maybe.
( ) Yes, if both sections have the same number of students, otherwise no.
( ) No.

Is `mean_3` equal to `mean_1`?

( ) Yes.
( ) Yes, if both sections have the same number of students, otherwise maybe.
( ) Yes, if both sections have the same number of students, otherwise no.
( ) No.
