Below, we define a new `DataFrame` called `seven_apps` and display it fully.

``` py
seven_apps = apps.sample(7).sort_values(by="dependents", ascending=False)
seven_apps

Consider the process of **resampling 7 rows** from `seven_apps` **with replacement**, and computing the maximum number of dependents in the resample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
If we take one resample, what is the probability that the maximum number of dependents in the resample is **less than** 3? Leave your answer **unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>

Of the 7 rows in the `seven_apps` DataFrame, there are 6 rows that have a value less than 3 in the `dependents` column. This means that if we were to sample **one row** from `seven_apps`, there is a $\frac{6}{7}$ chance that we select one of the rows that have less than 3 dependents. The question is asking what the probability that the maximum number of dependents in the **resample** is less than 3. One resample of the DataFrame is equivalent to sampling one row from `seven_apps` 7 different times, without replacement. Since we sample one row from `seven_apps` 7 times, and the probability of one resampled row having a value less than 3 is $\frac{6}{7}$, the total probability of observing one resample of `seven_apps` having a maximum value less than 3 would be ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>350</sup>

The number of dependents in `seven_apps` that is not 3 is the same number of dependents in `seven_apps` that is less than 3. We know from the previous part of this question that the probability of one resample of `seven_apps` having a maximum number of depdendents less than 3 is ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>. Each resample of `seven_apps` is indepdendent of each other, meaning that the values in one resample of `seven_apps` doesn't affect the values of the other resamples. This means that the probability of 50 resamples of `seven_apps` having a maximum number of dependents that is never 3 is (($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>)<sup>50</sup> = ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>350</sup>.

If we take 50 resamples, what is the probability that the maximum number of dependents is 3 in **every** resample? Leave your answer **unsimplified**.



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** (1 - ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>)<sup>50</sup>

We'll first take a look at the probability of one resample of `seven_apps` having the maximum number of dependents be 3. In order for the maximum number of depdendents of one resample of `seven_apps` be equal to 3, at least one row must have a value in the `dependents` column equalling to 3. The probability of at least one row having 3 dependents in one resample of `seven_apps` is equal to the complement of the probability of there being no rows in `seven_apps` that have 3 dependents. In the first part of this problem, we found that this probability was ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>. The complement of this probability, which is the probability that at least one row in the resample has 3 dependents, is 1 - ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>. 

Now that we know the probability of one resample having the maximum number of dependents be 3, we can calculate the probability that 50 resamples all have a maximum number of dependents be 3. Since each resample of `seven_apps` is independent from one another, the probability that the maximum number of dependents is 3 in every resample is (1 - ($\frac{6}{7}$)<sup>7</sup>)<sup>50</sup>.
