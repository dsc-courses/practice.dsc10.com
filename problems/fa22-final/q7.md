Below, we define a new `DataFrame` called `seven_apps` and display it fully.

``` py
seven_apps = apps.sample(7).sort_values(by="dependents", ascending=False)
seven_apps

Consider the process of **resampling 7 rows from `seven_apps` with replacement**, and computing the maximum number of dependents in the resample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
If we take one resample, what is the probability that the maximum number of dependents in the resample is **less than** 3? Leave your answer **unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left( 1 - \frac{1}{7}\right)^7 = \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7$

Of the 7 rows in the `seven_apps` DataFrame, there are 6 rows that have a value less than 3 in the `dependents` column. This means that if we were to sample **one row** from `seven_apps`, there would be a $\frac{6}{7}$ chance of selecting one of the rows that has less than 3 dependents. The question is asking what the probability that the maximum number of dependents in the resample is less than 3. One resample of the DataFrame is equivalent to sampling one row from `seven_apps` 7 different times, without replacement. So the probability of getting a row with less than 3 dependents, 7 times consecutively, is $\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
If we take 50 resamples, what is the probability that the maximum number of dependents is **never** 3, in any resample? Leave your answer **unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{7}\right)^7 \right]^{50} = \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^{350}$

We know from the previous part of this question that the probability of one resample of `seven_apps` having a maximum number of dependents less than 3 is $\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7$. Now we must repeat this process 50 times independently, and so the probability that all 50 resamples have a maximum number of dependents less than 3 is $\left(\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^{7}\right)^{50} = \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^{350}$. Another way to interpret this is that we must select 350 rows, one a time, such that none of them are the one row containing 3 dependents.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
If we take 50 resamples, what is the probability that the maximum number of dependents is 3 in **every** resample? Leave your answer **unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{7}\right)^7 \right]^{50} = \left[1 - \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7 \right]^{50}$

We'll first take a look at the probability of **one resample** of `seven_apps` having the maximum number of dependents be 3. In order for this to happen, at least one row of the 7 selected for the resample must be the row containing 3 dependents. The probability of getting this row at least once is equal to the complement of the probability of never getting this row, which we calculated in part (a) to be $\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7$. Therefore, the probability that at least one row in the resample has 3 dependents, is $1 -\left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7$. 

Now that we know the probability of getting one resample where the maximum number of dependents is 3, we can calculate the probability that the same thing happens in 50 independent resamples by multiplying this probability by itself 50 times. Therefore, the probability that the maximum number of dependents is 3 in each of 50 resamples is $\left[1 - \left( \frac{6}{7}\right)^7 \right]^{50}$.
