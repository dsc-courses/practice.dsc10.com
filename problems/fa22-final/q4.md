# BEGIN SUBPROB

In our implementation of this permutation test, we followed the procedure outlined in lecture to draw new pairs of samples under the null hypothesis and compute test statistics --- that is, we randomly assigned each row to a group (approved or denied) by shuffling one of the columns in \texttt{apps}, then computed the test statistic on this random pair of samples.

Let's now explore an alternative solution to drawing pairs of samples under the null hypothesis and computing test statistics. Here’s the approach:

1. Shuffle, i.e. re-order, the rows of the DataFrame.
2. Use the values at the top of the resulting `"dependents"` column as the new "denied" sample, and the values at the at the bottom of the resulting `"dependents"` column as the new "approved" sample. Note that we don’t necessarily split the DataFrame exactly in half --- the sizes of these new samples depend on the number of "denied" and "approved" values in the original DataFrame!

Once we generate our pair of random samples in this way, we'll compute the test statistic on the random pair, as usual. Here, we'll use as our test statistic the difference between the mean number of dependents for denied and approved applicants, in the order **denied minus approved**.

**Fill in the blanks to complete the simulation below.**

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Anwser: **

Blank A: `df.sample(df.shape[0])`

Blank B: `df.take(np.arange(denied))`

Blank C: `df.take(np.arange(denied+1, df.shape[0]))`
