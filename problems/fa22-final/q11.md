Suppose variables `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `v4`, have already been
initialized to specific numerical values. Right now, we don't know what
values they've been set to.

The function `f` shown below takes in a number, `v`, and outputs an
integer between -2 and 2, depending on the value of `v` relative to
`v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `v4`.

```py
def f(v):
    if v <= v1:
        return -2
    elif v <= v2:
        return -1
    elif v <= v3:
        return 0
    elif v <= v4:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2
```

Recall that in the previous problem, we created an array called
`sample_means` containing 10,000 values, each of which is the mean of
a random sample of 100 applicant ages drawn from the DataFrame `apps`,
in which ages have a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10.

When we call the function `f` on every value `v` in `sample_means`, we
produce a collection of 10,000 values all between -2 and 2. A density
histogram of these values is shown below.

The heights of the five bars in this histogram, reading from left to
right, are

$$x, 3x, 12x, 3x, x.$$

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the value of $x$ (i.e. the height of the shortest bar in
the histogram)? Give your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{1}{20}$

In any density histogram, the total area of all bars is 1. This histogram has five bars, each of which has a width of 1 (e.g. $3 - 2 = 1$). Since $\text{Area} = \text{Height} \cdot \text{Width}$, we have that the area of each bar is equal to its height. So, the total area of the histogram in this case is the sum of the heights of each bar:

$$\text{Total Area} = x + 3x + 12x + 3x + x = 20x$$

Since we know that the total area is equal to 1, we have

$$20x = 1 \implies \boxed{x = \frac{1}{20}}$$

this question without them!

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 7,500

First, it's a good idea to understand what the integer we're trying to find actually means in the context of the information provided. In this case, it's the number of sample means that are greater than `v2` and less than or equal to `v4`. Here's how to arrive at that conclusion:

1. First, note that `sample_means` is an array of length 10,000.
2. `sample_means > v2` and `sample_means <= v4` are both Boolean arrays of length 10,000. 
3. `(sample_means > v2) & (sample_means <= v4)` is also a Boolean array of length 10,000, which contains `True` for every sample mean that is greater than `v2` and less than or equal to `v4` and `False` for every other sample mean. 
4. Finally, `np.count_nonzero((sample_means > v2) & (sample_means <= v4))` is a **number** between 0 and 10,000, corresponding to the number of `True` elements in the array `(sample_means > v2) & (sample_means <= v4)`.

Remember, the histogram we're looking at visualizes the distribution of the 10,000 values that result from calling `f` on every value in `sample_means`. To proceed, we need to understand _how_ the function `f` decides what value to return for a given input, `v`:

- If the input `v` is greater than `v2`, then the first two conditions (`v <= v1` and `v <= v2`) are `False`, and so the only possible values of `f(v)` are `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- If the input `v` is less than or equal to `v4`, the only possible values of `f(v)` are `-2`, `-1`, `0`, `1`.
- **Thus, if the input `v` is greater than `v2` _and_ less than or equal to `v4`, the only possible values of `f(v)` are `0` and `1`.**

Now, our job boils down to finding the number of values in the visualized distribution that are equal to 0 or 1. This is equivalent to finding the number of values that fall in the $[0, 1)$ and $[1, 2)$ bins – since `f` only returns integer values, the only value in the $[0, 1)$ bin is 0 and the only value in the $[1, 2)$ bin is 1 (remember, histogram bins are left-inclusive and right-exclusive).

To do this, we need to find the _proportion_ of values in those two bins, and multiply that proportion by the total number of values (10,000). 

We know that the area of a bar is equal to the proportion of values in that bin. We also know that, **in this case**, the area of each bar is equal to its height, since the width of each bin is 1. Thus, the proportion of values in a given bin is equal to the height of the corresponding bar. As such, the proportion of values in the $[0, 1)$ bin is $12x$, and the proportion of values in the $[1, 2)$ bin is $3x$, meaning the proportion of values in the histogram that are equal to either 0 or 1 is $12x + 3x = 15x$.

In the previous subpart, we found that $x = \frac{1}{20}$, so the proportion of values in the histogram that are equal either 0 or 1 is $15 \cdot \frac{1}{20} = \frac{3}{4}$*, and since there are 10,000 values being visualized in the histogram total, $\frac{3}{4} \cdot 10,000 = 7,500$ of them are equal to either 0 or 1.

Thus, 7,500 of the values in `sample_means` are greater than `v2` and less than or equal to `v4`, so `np.count_nonzero((sample_means > v2) & (sample_means <= v4))` evaluates to 7,500.

_Note: It's possible to answer this subpart without knowing the value of $x$, i.e. without answering the previous subpart. The area of the $[0, 1)$ and $[1, 2)$ bars is $15x$, and the total area of the histogram is $20x$. So, the proportion of the area in $[0, 1)$ or $[1, 2)$ is $\frac{15x}{20x} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}$, which is the same value we found by substituting $x = \frac{1}{20}$ into $15x$._

What is the value of `v3`, one of the variables used in the
function `f`? Give your answer as a number.

*Hint*: Use the histogram as well as one of the rows of the table above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 35.84

The table provided above tells us the proportion of values within $u$ standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution, for various values of $u$. For instance, it tells us that the proportion of values within 1.28 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution is 0.8.

Let's reflect on what we know at the moment:

- The distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal, by the Central Limit Theorem. Normal distributions are symmetric, and have a "peak" at the center. The histogram above is also symmetric and has its peak at its center.
- The proportion of values in the histogram that are equal to 0 is $12x = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{20} = 0.6$.
- The function `f` returns 0 for all inputs that are greater than `v2` and less than or equal to `v3`. This, combined with the fact above, tells us that **the proportion of sample means between `v2` (exclusive) and `v3` (inclusive) is 0.6**.
- From the table provided, we know that in a normal distribution, the proportion of values within 0.84 standard deviations of the mean is 0.6.

Combining the facts above, we have that `v2` is 0.84 standard deviations below the mean of the sample mean's distribution and `v3` is 0.84 standard deviations above the mean of the sample mean's distribution.

The sample mean's distribution has the following characteristics:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Mean of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= \text{Population Mean} = 35 \\
\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= \frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{100}} = 1
\end{align*}
$$

0.84 standard deviations above the mean of the sample mean's distribution is:

$$35 + 0.84 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{100}} = 35 + 0.84 \cdot 1 = \boxed{35.84}$$

So, the value of `v3` is 35.84.

Which of the following is closest to the value of the expression
below?

```py
np.percentile(sample_means, 5)
```

( ) 14 
( ) 14.75 
( ) 33
( ) 33.35
( ) 33.72

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 33.35

The table provided tells us that in a normal distribution, 90% of values are within 1.65 standard deviations of the mean. Since normal distributions are symmetric, it also means that 5% of values are above 1.65 standard deviations of the mean and, more importantly, **5% of values are below 1.65 standard deviations of the mean**.

The 5th percentile of a distribution is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to 5% of values, so in this case the 5th percentile is 1.65 SDs below the mean. As in the previous subpart, the mean and SD we are referring to are the mean and SD of the distribution of sample means (`sample_means`), which we found to be 35 and 1, respectively.

1.65 standard deviations below this mean is

$$35 - 1.65 \cdot 1 = \boxed{33.35}$$
