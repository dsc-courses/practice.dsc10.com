The DataFrame `apps` contains application data for a random sample of 1,000 applicants for a particular credit card from the 1990s. The columns are:

-   `"status" (str)`: Whether the credit card application was approved:
    `"approved"` or `"denied"` values only.

-   `"age" (float)`: The applicant's age, in years, to the nearest
    twelfth of a year.

-   `"income" (float)`: The applicant's annual income, in tens of
    thousands of dollars.

-   `"homeowner" (str)`: Whether the credit card applicant owns their
    own home: `"yes"` or `"no"` values only.

-   `"dependents" (int)`: The number of dependents, or individuals that
    rely on the applicant as a primary source of income, such as
    children.

The first few rows of `apps` are shown below, though remember that
`apps` has 1,000 rows.
