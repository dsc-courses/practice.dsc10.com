In this question, we'll explore the relationship between the ages and incomes of credit card applicants.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The credit card company that owns the data in apps, BruinCard, has decided not to give us access to the entire `apps` DataFrame, but instead just a sample of `apps` called `small apps`.
We’ll start by using the information in `small_apps` to compute the regression line that predicts the age of an applicant given their income.

For an applicant with an income that is $\frac{8}{3}$ standard deviations above the mean income, we predict their age to be $\frac{4}{5}$ standard deviations above the mean age. What is the correlation coefficient, $r$, between incomes and ages in `small_apps`? Give your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $r = \frac{3}{10}$

To find the correlation coefficient $r$ we use the equation of the regression line in standard units and solve for $r$ as follows.
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} &= r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}} \\
\frac{4}{5} &= r \cdot \frac{8}{3} \\
r &= \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{8} \\
r &= \frac{3}{10}
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we want to predict the income of an applicant given their age. We will
again use the information in `small_apps` to find the regression line.
The regression line predicts that an applicant whose age is $\frac{4}{5}$ standard deviations above the mean age has an income that is $s$ standard deviations above the mean income. What is the value of $s$? Give your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**  $s = \frac{6}{25}$

We again use the equation of the regression line in standard units, with the value of $r$ we found in the previous part.
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} &= r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}} \\
s &= \frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\
s &= \frac{6}{25}
\end{align*}
$$

Notice that when we predict income based on age, our predictions are different than when we predict age based on income. That is, the answer to this question is **not** $\frac{8}{3}$. We can think of this phenomenon as a consequence of *regression to the mean* which means that the predicted variable is always closer to average than the original variable. In part (a), we start with an income of $\frac{8}{3}$ standard units and predict an age of $\frac{4}{5}$ standard units, which is closer to average than $\frac{8}{3}$ standard units. Then in part (b), we start with an age of $\frac{4}{5}$ and predict an income of $\frac{6}{25}$ standard units, which is closer to average than $\frac{4}{5}$ standard units. This happens because whenever we make a prediction, we multiply by $r$ which is less than one in magnitude.

BruinCard has now taken away our access to both `apps` and `small_apps`, and has instead given us access to an even smaller sample of `apps` called `mini_apps`. In `mini_apps`, we know the following information:
- All incomes and ages are positive numbers.
- There is a positive linear association between incomes and ages.

We use the data in `mini_apps` to find the regression line that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant given their age. Just to test the limits of this regression line, we use it to predict the income of an applicant who is **-2 years old**, even though it doesn’t make sense for a person to have a negative age.

Let $I$ be the regression line’s prediction of this applicant’s income. Which of the following inequalities are guaranteed to be satisfied? Select all that apply.

[ ] $I < 0$
[ ] $I < \text{mean income}$
[ ] $| I - \text{mean income}| \leq | \text{mean age} + 2 |$
[ ] $\dfrac{| I - \text{mean income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \leq \dfrac{| \text{mean age} + 2 |}{\text{standard deviation of ages}}$
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**  $I < \text{mean income}$, $\dfrac{| I - \text{mean income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \leq \dfrac{| \text{mean age} + 2 |}{\text{standard deviation of ages}}$

To understand this answer, we will investigate each option.

- $I < 0$:  

This option asks whether income is guaranteed to be negative. This is not necessarily true. For example, it's possible that the slope of the regression line is $2$ and the intercept is $10$, in which case the income associated with a $-2$ year old would be $6$, which is positive.

- $I < \text{mean income}$: 

This option asks whether the predicted income is guaranteed to be lower than the mean income. It helps to think in standard units. In standard units, the regression line goes through the point $(0, 0)$ and has slope $r$, which we are told is positive. This means that for a below-average $x$, the predicted $y$ is also below average. So this statement must be true.


- $| I - \text{mean income}| \leq | \text{mean age} + 2 |$: 

First, notice that $| \text{mean age} + 2 | = | -2 - \text{mean age}|$, which represents the horizontal distance betweeen these two points on the regression line: $(\text{mean age}, \text{mean income})$, $(-2, I)$. Likewise, $| I - \text{mean income}|$ represents the vertical distance between those same two points. So the inequality can be interpreted as a question of whether the *rise* of the regression line is less than or equal to the *run*, or whether the slope is at most 1. That's not guaranteed when we're working in original units, as we are here, so this option is not necessarily true.

- $\dfrac{| I - \text{mean income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \leq \dfrac{| \text{mean age} + 2 |}{\text{standard deviation of ages}}$: 

Since standard deviation cannot be negative, we have $$\dfrac{| I - \text{mean income}|}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} = \left| \dfrac{I - \text{mean income}}{\text{standard deviation of incomes}} \right| = I_{\text{(su)}}.$$ Similarly, $$\dfrac{|\text{mean age} + 2|}{\text{standard deviation of ages}} = \left| \dfrac{-2 - \text{mean age}}{\text{standard deviation of ages}} \right| = -2_{\text{(su)}}.$$ So this option is asking about whether the predicted income, in standard units, is guaranteed to be less (in absolute value) than the age. Since we make predictions in standard units using the equation of the regression line $\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} = r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}}$ and we know $|r|\leq 1$, this means $|\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}}| \leq | x_{\text{(su)}}|$. Applying this to ages ($x$) and incomes ($y$), this says exactly what the given inequality says. This is the phenomenon we call *regression to the mean*.

 Yet again, BruinCard, the company that gave us access to `apps`,
`small_apps`, and `mini_apps`, has revoked our access to those three
DataFrames and instead has given us `micro_apps`, an even smaller sample
of `apps`.

Using `micro_apps`, we are again interested in finding the regression
line that will allow us to predict the income of an applicant given
their age. We are given the following information:

-   The correlation coefficient, $r$, between ages and incomes is
    $-\frac{1}{3}$ (note the negative sign).
-   The mean income is $\frac{7}{2}$ (remember, incomes are measured in
    tens of thousands of dollars).
-   The mean age is 33.
-   The regression line predicts that a 24 year old applicant has an
    income of $\frac{31}{2}$.

Suppose the standard deviation of incomes in `micro_apps` is an integer
multiple of the standard deviation of ages in `micro_apps`. That is,

$$\text{standard deviation of income} = k \cdot \text{standard deviation of age}.$$

What is the value of $k$? Give your answer as an **integer**.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**  $k = 4$

To find this answer, we'll use the definition of the regression line in original units, which is $\text{predicted } y = mx+b$, where
$$m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x}, \: \: b = \text{mean of } y - m \cdot \text{mean of } x$$

Next we substitute these value for $m$ and $b$ into $\text{predicted } y = mx + b$, interpret $x$ as age and $y$ as income, and use the given information to find $k$.
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y &= mx+b \\
\text{predicted } y &= r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x} \cdot x+ \text{mean of } y - r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x} \cdot \text{mean of } x\\
\text{predicted income}&= r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of income}}{\text{SD of age}} \cdot \text{age}+ \text{mean income} - r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of income}}{\text{SD of age}} \cdot \text{mean age} \\
\frac{31}{2}&= -\frac{1}{3} \cdot k \cdot 24+ \frac{7}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot k \cdot 33 \\
\frac{31}{2}&= -8k+ \frac{7}{2} + 11k \\
\frac{31}{2}&= 3k+ \frac{7}{2}  \\
3k &= \frac{31}{2} - \frac{7}{2} \\
3k &= 12 \\
k &= 4 
\end{align*}
$$

Another way to solve this problem uses the equation of the regression line in standard units and the definition of standard units.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{predicted } y_{\text{(su)}} &= r \cdot x_{\text{(su)}} \\
\frac{\text{predicted income} - \text{mean income}}{\text{SD of income}} &= r \cdot \frac{\text{age} - \text{mean age}}{\text{SD of age}} \\
\frac{\frac{31}{2} - \frac{7}{2}}{k\cdot \text{SD of age}} &= -\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{24 - 33}{\text{SD of age}} \\
\frac{12}{k\cdot \text{SD of age}} &= -\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{-9}{\text{SD of age}} \\
\frac{12}{k\cdot \text{SD of age}} &= \frac{3}{\text{SD of age}} \\
\frac{k\cdot \text{SD of age}}{\text{SD of age}}  &= \frac{12}{3}\\
k &= 4
\end{align*}
$$
