The credit card company that owns the data in `apps`, BruinCard, has decided not to give us access to the entire `apps` DataFrame, but instead just a random sample of 100 rows of apps called `hundred_apps`.

We are interested in estimating the mean age of all applicants in `apps` given only the data
in `hundred_apps`. The ages in `hundred_apps` have a mean of 35 and a standard deviation of 10.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Give the endpoints of the CLT-based 95% confidence interval for the mean age of all applicants in `apps`, based on the data in `hundred_apps`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Left Endpoint = 33, Right Endpoint = 37

According to the Central Limit Theorem, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval for the sample mean using:
$$
\left[\text{sample mean} - 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}},
\text{sample mean} + 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
\right]
$$

The mean, standard deviation, and sample size of the ages in `hundred_apps` is given to us, so plugging in those values gives us:

 \[35 - 2 $\cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{100}}$, 35 + 2 $\cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{100}}$]

= \[35 - 2 $\cdot$ 1, 35 + 2 $\cdot$ 1]

= \[33, 37]

Which of the following three visualizations best depict the distribution of `sample_means`?

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa22-final/3hist.jpg' width=45%></center>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 1

Let's examine each one of our options:

- Option 1: This histogram is centered around 35, which is the mean of the ages in `hundred_apps`. In the first part of this question, we found that the 95% confidence interval for the mean age of all applicants in `apps` was [33, 37]. 95% of our values appear to lie in this range in this histogram. Thus, option 1 is correct.
- Option 2: This histogram is centered around 35, but has a much larger spread than the histogram in option 1. The 95% confidence interval endpoints appear to be much more extreme than what is expected given the answer in the first part of the question.
- Option 3: Like the previous two options, the histogram is centered around 35, but the 95% confidence interval endpoints appear to be closer to 30 and 40, rather than 33 and 37, which is what we found in the first part of the question.

Which of the following statements are guaranteed to be true? Select all that
apply.

[_] We used bootstrapping to compute sample means

[_] The ages of credit card applicants are roughly normally distributed.

[_] A CLT-based 90% confidence interval for the mean age of credit card applicants, based on the data in hundred apps, would be narrower than the interval you gave in part (a).

[_] The expression np.percentile(sample means, 2.5) evaluates to the left endpoint of the interval you gave in part (a).

[_] If we used the data in hundred apps to create 1,000 CLT-based 95% confidence intervals for the mean age of applicants in apps, approximately 950 of them would contain the true mean age of applicants in apps.

[_] None of the above.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 3 (A CLT-based 90% confidence interval for the mean age of credit card applicants, based on the data in `hundred_apps`, would be narrower than the interval you gave in part (a).)

Let's analyze each of the options:

Option 1: We are not using bootstrapping to compute sample means since we are sampling from the `apps` DataFrame, which is from the population, rather than re-sampling from our sample DataFrame, `hundred_apps`.

Option 2: We can't be sure what the distribution of the ages of credit card applicants are. The histograms above show that the distribution of sample means is roughly normally distributed (by the Central Limit Theorem), but the histograms don't tell us anything about the population distribution.

Option 3: A 90% confidence interval would capture 90% of the resampled mean ages. 90% of the resampled mean ages is less than 95% of the resampled mean ages, and so the 90% confidence interval would capture a narrower interval than a 95% confidence interval.

Option 4: The answer in the first part of the question is calculated using the Central Limit Theorem, whereas using `np.percentile(sample_means, 2.5)` is empirically (using resamples) calculating the endpoints of a confidence interval. Empirically calculating a confidence interval doesn't necessarily always give the same endpoints as using the Central Limit Theorem, but it should give you values close to those endpoints.

Option 5: A 95% confidence interval doesn't tell us the percentage of our intervals that contain the true mean age in `apps`. Rather, a 95% confidence interval is saying that the process generates a good interval 95% of the time. The 95% confidence is in the process that generates the interval.
