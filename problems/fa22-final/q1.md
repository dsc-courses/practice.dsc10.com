In this question, we'll explore the number of dependents of each applicant. To begin, let's define the variable dep_counts as follows. 

`dep_counts = apps.groupby("dependents").count().get(["status"])`

The visualization below shows the distribution of the numbers of dependents per applicant. Note that every applicant has 6 or fewer dependents.

Use `dep_counts` and the visualization above to answer the following questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the type of the variable `dep_counts`?

( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** DataFrame

As usual, `.groupby` produces a new DataFrame. Then we use `.get` on this DataFrame with a list as the input, which produces a DataFrame with just one column. Remember that `.get("status")` produces a Series, but `.get(["status"])` produces a DataFrame

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type of data visualization is shown above?

( ) line plot
( ) scatter plot
( ) bar chart
( ) histogram

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** histogram 

This is a histogram because the number of dependents per applicant is a numerical variable. It makes sense, for example, to subtract the number of dependents for two applicants to see how many more dependents one applicant has than the other. Histograms show distributions of numerical variables.

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many of the 1,000 applicants in `apps` have 2 or more dependents? Give your answer as an **integer**. 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 400 

The bars of a density histogram have a combined total area of 1, and the area in any bar represents the proportion of values that fall in that bin. 

In tihs problem, we want the total area of the bins corresponding to 2 or more dependents. Since this involves 5 bins, whose exact heights are unclear, we will instead calculate the proportion of all applicants with 0 or 1 dependents, and then subtract this proportion from 1. 

Since the width of each bin is 1, we have for each bin,
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Area} &= \text{Height} \cdot \text{Width}\\
\text{Area} &= \text{Height}.
\end{align*}$$

Since the height of the first bar is 0.4, this means a proportion of 0.4 applicants have 0 dependents. Similarly, since the height of the second bar is 0.2, a proportion of 0.2 applicants have 1 dependent. This means $1-(0.4+0.2) = 0.4$ proportion of applicants have 2 or more dependents. Since there are 1,000 applicants total, this is 400 applicants.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Define the DataFrame `dependents_status` as follows.

`dependents_status = apps.groupby(["dependents", "status"]).count()`

What is the maximum number of rows that `dependents_status` could have? Give your answer as an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 14 

When we group by multiple columns, the resulting DataFrame has one row for each combination of values in those columns. Since there are 7 possible values for `"dependents"` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 2 possible values for `"status"` (`"approved"`, `"denied"`), this means there are $7\cdot 2 = 14$ possible combinations of values for these two columns.

<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Recall that `dep_counts` is defined as follows.

`dep_counts = apps.groupby("dependents").count().get(["status"])`

Below, we define several more variables.

```py        
variable1 = dep_counts[dep_counts.get("status") >= 2].sum()

variable2 = dep_counts[dep_counts.index > 2].get("status").sum() 

variable3 = (dep_counts.get("status").sum() 
            - dep_counts[dep_counts.index < 2].get("status").sum())
            
variable4 = dep_counts.take(np.arange(2, 7)).get("status").sum()

variable5 = (dep_counts.get("status").sum() 
            - dep_counts.get("status").loc[1] 
            - dep_counts.get("status").loc[2])
```

Which of these variables are equal to your answer from part (c)? Select all that apply.

[ ] `variable1`
[ ] `variable2`
[ ] `variable3`
[ ] `variable4`
[ ] `variable5`
[ ] None of the above.
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `variable3`, `variable4`

First, the DataFrame `dep_counts` is indexed by `"dependents"` and has just one column, called `"status"` containing the number of applicants with each number of dependents. For example, `dep_counts` may look like the DataFrame shown below.

<center><img src='../assets/images/fa22-final/dep_counts.jpg' width=10%></center>
<br>

`variable1` does not work because it doesn't make sense to query with the condition `dep_counts.get("status") >= 2`. In the example `dep_counts` shown above, all rows would satisfy this condition, but not all rows correspond to applicants with 2 or more dependents. We should be querying based on the values in the index instead.

`variable2` is close but it uses a strict inequality `>` where it should use `>=` because we want to include applicants with 2 dependents.

`variable3` is correct. It uses the same approach we used in part (c). That is, in order to calculate the number of applicants with 2 or more dependents, we calculate the total number of applicants minus the number of applicants with less than 2 dependents.

`variable4` works as well. The strategy here is to keep only the rows that correspond to 2 or more dependents. Recall that `np.arange(2, 7)` evaluates to the array `np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`. Since we are told that each applicant has 6 or fewer dependents, keeping only these rows correspondings to keeping all applicants with 2 or more dependents.

`variable5` does not work because it subtracts away the applicants with 1 or 2 dependents, leaving the applicants with 0, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dependents. This is not what we want.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Next, we define variables `x` and `y` as follows.

```py   
x = dep_counts.index.values
y = dep_counts.get("status")
```

*Note*: If `idx` is the index of a Series or DataFrame, `idx.values` gives the values in `idx` **as an array**.

Which of the following expressions evaluate to the mean number of dependents? Select all that apply.

[ ] `np.mean(x * y)`
[ ] `x.sum() / y.sum()`
[ ] `(x * y / y.sum()).sum()`
[ ] `np.mean(x)`
[ ] `(x * y).sum() / y.sum()`
[ ] None of the above.
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `(x * y / y.sum()).sum()`, `(x * y).sum() / y.sum()`

We know that `x` is `np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` and `y` is a Series containing the number of applicants with each number of dependents. We don't know the exact values of the data in `y`, but we do know there are 7 elements that sum to 1000, the first two of which are 400 and 200.

`np.mean(x * y)` does not work because `x * y` has 7 elements, so `np.mean(x * y)` is equivalent to `sum(x * y) / 7`, but the mean number of dependents should be `sum(x * y) / 1000` since there are 1000 applicants.

`x.sum() / y.sum()` evaluates to $\frac{21}{1000}$ regardless of how many applicants have each number of dependents, so it must be incorrect.

`(x * y / y.sum()).sum()` works. We can think of `y / y.sum()` as a Series containing the proportion of applicants with each number of dependents. For example, the first two entries of `y / y.sum()` are 0.4 and 0.2. When we multiply this Series by `x` and sum up all 7 entries, the result is a weighted average of the different number of dependents, where the weights are given by the proportion of applicants with each number of dependents.

`np.mean(x)` evaluates to 3 regardless of how many applicants have each number of dependents, so it must be incorrect.

`(x * y).sum() / y.sum()` works because the numerator `(x * y).sum()` represents the total number of dependents across all 1,000 applicants and the denominator is the number of applicants, or 1,000. The total divided by the count gives the mean number of dependents.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What does the expression `y.iloc[0] / y.sum()` evaluate to? Give your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.4

`y.iloc[0]` represents the number of applicants with 0 dependents, which is 400. `y.sum()` represents the total number of applicants, which is 1,000. So the ratio of these is 0.4.
