In this question, we'll explore the number of dependents of each applicant. To begin, let's define the variable dep_counts as follows. 

`dep_counts = apps.groupby("dependents").count().get(["status"])`

The visualization below shows the distribution of the numbers of dependents	per applicant. Note that every applicant has 6 or fewer dependents.

Use `dep_counts` and the visualization above to answer the following questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the type of the variable `dep_counts`?

( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** DataFrame

- The result of running .groupby is a new DataFrame. 
- Misconseption: .get("status") results in a Series while .get(["status"]) results in a DataFrame 

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type of data visualization is shown above?

( ) line plot
( ) scatter plot
( ) bar chart
( ) histogram

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** histogram 

- Histogram is the distribution of numerical values. 
- In the visualization above we are plotting the distribution of the nuber of depedents per applicant.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many of the 1,000 applicants in apps have 2 or more dependents? Give you answer as an integer. 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 400 

- The bars of a density histogram have a combined total area of 1. 
- We must calcualte the area (proportion) of applicants with 2 or more dependnets. 
- $$\text{Area} = \text{Height} \times \text{Width}$$

- First, calculate the proportion of applicants with 0 dependents + 1 dependents
- Second, subtract the above proportion from 1.0 to find the total applicants with 2 or more dependents.

- Number of applicants with 0 dependents
	- Width = 1
	- Height = 0.4
	- Area = 0.4 Therefore, 40% of applicants have 0 dependents
	
- Number of applicants with 1 dependent 
	- Width = 1 
	- Height = 0.2
	- Area = 0.2 Therefore, 20% of applicants have 1 dependent	

- Number of applicants with 2 or more dependents 
	- 1 - (0.4 + 0.2) = 0.4
	
- 40% means 400 of the 1000 of applicants have 2 or more dependents

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Define the DataFrame dependents_status as follows.

`dependents_status = apps.groupby(["dependents", "status"]).count()`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# END PROB
