# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 4

The line `one_age = min(75, one_age)` either leaves `one_age` alone or sets it equal to 75 if the age was higher than 75, which means anyone over age 75 is considered to be 75 years old for the purposes of classifying them into age categories. From the return statement, we know we need our value for `bin_pos` to be either 0, 1 ,2 or 3 since `cat_names` has a length of 4. When we divide `one_age` by 25, we get a decimal number that represents how many times 25 fits into `one_age`. We want to round this number *down* to get the number of whole copies of 25 that fit into `one_age`. If that value is 0, it means the person is a `"young adult"`, if that value is 1, it means they are `"middle aged"`, and so on. The rounding down behavior that we want is accomplished by `int(one_age/25)`.

Which of the following is a correct way to fill in blank (c)?

( ) `age to bin(apps.get("age"))`
( ) `apps.get("age").apply(age to bin)`
( ) `apps.get("age").age to bin()`
( ) `apps.get("age").apply(age to bin(one age))`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** `apps.get("age").apply(age to bin)`

We want our result to be a Series because the next line in the code assigns it to
a DataFrame. We also need to use the `.apply()` method to apply our function to
the entirety of the `"age"` column. The `.apply()` method only takes in the name of 
a function and not its variables, as it treats the entries of the column as the 
variables directly.

Which of the following is a correct alternate implementation of the age to bin
function? Select all that apply.

Option 1: 
```py
def age_to_bin(one_age):
    bin_pos = 3
    if one_age < 25:
        bin_pos = 0
    if one_age < 50:
        bin_pos = 1
    if one_age < 75:
        bin_pos = 2
    return cat_names[bin_pos]
```

Option 2: 
```py
def age_to_bin(one_age):
    bin_pos = 3
    if one_age < 75:
        bin_pos = 2
    if one_age < 50:
        bin_pos = 1
    if one_age < 25:
        bin_pos = 0
    return cat_names[bin_pos]
```


Option 3: 
```py
def age_to_bin(one_age):
    bin_pos = 0
    for cutoff in np.arange(25, 100, 25):
        if one_age >= cutoff:
            bin_pos = bin_pos + 1 
    return cat_names[bin_pos]
```



Option 4: 
```py
def age_to_bin(one_age):
    bin_pos = -1
    for cutoff in np.arange(0, 100, 25):
        if one_age >= cutoff:
            bin_pos = bin_pos + 1 
        return cat_names[bin_pos]
```

[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Option 2 and Option 3

Option 1 doesn't work for inputs less than 25. For example, on an input of 10, every condition is satsified, so `bin_pos` will be set to 0, then 1, then 2, meaning the function will return `"older adult"` instead of `"young adult"`. 

Option 2 reverses the order of the conditions, which ensures that even when a number satisfies many conditions, the last one it satisfies determines the correct `bin_pos`. For example, 27 would satisfy the first 2 conditions but not the last one, and the function would return `"middle aged"` as expected.

In option 3, `np.arange(25, 100, 25)` produces `np.array([25,50,75])`. The `if` condition checks the whether the age is at least 25, then 50, then 75. For every time that it is, it adds to `bin_pos`, otherwise it keeps `bin_pos`. At the end, `bin_pos` represents the number of these values that the age is greater than or equal to, which correctly determines the age category.

Option 4 is equivalent to option 3 except for two things. First, `bin_pos` starts at -1, but since 0 is included in the set of `cutoff` values, the first time through the loop will set `bin_pos` to 0, as in Option 3. This change doesn't affect the behavior of the funtion. The other change, however, is that the `return` statement is inside the `for`-loop, which does change the behavior of the function dramatically. Now the `for`-loop will only run once, checking whether the age is at least 0 and then returning immediately. Since ages are always at least 0, this function will return `"young adult"` on every input, which is clearly incorrect.

We want to determine the number of `"middle aged"` applicants whose applications were denied. Fill in the blank below so that `count` evaluates to that number.

```py
df = apps_cat.________.reset_index()
count = df[(df.get("age_category") == "middle aged") & 
           (df.get("status") == "denied")].get("income").iloc[0]
```

What goes in the blank?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** `groupby(["age_category", "status"]).count()`

We can tell by the line in which `count` is defined that `df` needs to have columns called `"age category"`, `"status"`, and `"income"` with one row such that the values in these columns are `"middle aged"`, `"denied"`, and the number of such applicants, respectively. Since there is one row corresponding to a possible combination of values for `"age category"` and `"status"`, this suggests we need to group by the pair of columns, since `.groupby` produces a DataFrame with one row for each possible combination of values in the columns we are grouping by. Since we want to know how many individuals have this combination of values for `"age category"` and `"status"`, we should use `.count()` as the aggregation method. Another clue to to use `.groupby` is the presence of `.reset_index()` which is needed to query based on columns called `"age category"` and `"status"`.

The total variation distance between the  distributions of `"age category"` for approved applications and denied applications is 0.4.

One of the visualizations below shows the  distributions of `"age category"` for approved applications and denied applications. Which visualization is it?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Option 2

TVD represents the total overrepresentation of one distrubtion, summed across all categories. To find the TVD visually, we can estimate how much each bar for approved applications extends beyond the corresponding bar for denied applications in each bar chart. 

In Option 1, the approved bar extends beyond the denied bar only in the `"young adult"` category, and by 0.2, so the TVD for Option 1 is 0.2. In Option 2, the approved bar extends beyond the denied bar only in the `"older adult"` category, and by 0.4, so the TVD for Option 2 is 0.4. In Option 3, the approved bar extends beyond the denied bar in `"elderly"` by 0.2 and in `"young adult"` by 0.4, for a TVD of 0.6. In Option 4, the approved bar extends beyond the denied bar in `"young adult only"` by 0.2, for a TVD of 0.2. 

Note that even without knowing the exact lengths of the bars in Option 2, we can still conclude that Option 2 is correct by process of elimination, since it's the only one whose TVD appears close to 0.4
