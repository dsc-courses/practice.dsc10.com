Choose the best tool to answer each of the following questions. Note the following:

- By "hypothesis testing", we mean "standard" hypothesis testing, i.e. hypothesis testing that **doesn't** involve permutation testing or bootstrapping.
- By "bootstrapping", we mean bootstrapping that **doesn't** involve hypothesis testing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Are incomes of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents drawn randomly from the distribution of incomes of all applicants?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Hypothesis Testing

This is a question of whether a certain set of incomes (corresponding to applicants with 2 or fewer dependents) are drawn randomly from a certain population (incomes of all applicants). We need to use hypothesis testing to determine whether this model for how samples are drawn from a population seems plausible.

<average>47</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the median income of credit card applicants with 2 or fewer dependents?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Bootstrapping

The question is looking for an estimate a specific parameter (the median income of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents), so we know boostrapping is the best tool. 

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Are credit card applications approved through a random process in which 50% of applications are approved?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Hypothesis Testing

The question asks about the validity of a model in which applications are approved randomly such that each application has a 50% chance of being approved. To determine whether this model is plausible, we should use a standard hypothesis test to simulate this random process many times and see if the data generated according to this model is consistent with our observed data. 

<average>74</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Is the median income of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents less than the median income of applicants with 3 or more dependents?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Permutation Testing

Recall, a permutation test helps us decide whether two random samples come from the same distribution. This question is about whether two random samples for different groups of applicants have the same distribution of incomes or whether they don't because one group's median incomes is less than the other.

<average>57</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

 What is the difference in median income of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents and applicants with 3 or more dependents?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Bootstrapping

The question at hand is looking for a specific parameter value (the difference in median incomes for two different subsets of the applicants). Since this is a question of estimating an unknown parameter, bootstrapping is the best tool. 

<average>63</average>
