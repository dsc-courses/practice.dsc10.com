Choose the best tool to answer each of the following questions. Note the following:

- By "hypothesis testing", we mean "standard" hypothesis testing, i.e. hypothesis testing that **doesn't** involve permutation testing or bootstrapping.
- By "bootstrapping", we mean bootstrapping that **doesn't** involve hypothesis testing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Are incomes of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents drawn randomly from the distribution of incomes of all applicants?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Hypothesis Testing

The question at hand is dealing with questioning a world where applicants of 2 or fewer dependents are considered to 
drawn from the distribution as all applicants. To test the validity of this underlying model, we need to use a hypothesis
test to see how the observed difference of these applicants compares with the assumed model (the world under the null).

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the median income of credit card applicants with 2 or fewer dependents?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Bootstrapping

The question at hand is looking for a specific parameter (the median income), so we know boostrapping
is the best choice by definition. 

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Are credit card applications approved through a random process in which 50% of applications are approved?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Hypothesis Testing

The question asks about the approval process of credit card applications under a world where 50% of applications are approved.
This is a testable hypothesis/model, that we can question using a hypothesis test to see what the true world of approval looks like
under the null. Consequently, hypothesis testing is most suitable for this question. 


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Is the median income of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents less than the median income of applicants with 3 or more dependents?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Permutation Testing

Recall, a permutation test helps us decide whether two random samples come from the same distribution. The question above 
fundamentally is testing if a random for median income of 2 or fewer dependents is different in the distribution it comes from 
than the median income for 3 or more dependents. 

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

 What is the difference in median income of applicants with 2 or fewer dependents and applicants with 3 or more dependents?
( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Anwser:** Bootstrapping

The question at hand is looking for a specific difference between two distributions which indicates the solution
is bootstrapping by definition. If we were looking to see if these two groups came from the same underlying distribution, we would
then be dealing with permutation testing.
