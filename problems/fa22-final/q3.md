In `apps`, our sample of 1,000 credit card applications, 500 of the applications come from homeowners and 500 come from people who don't own their own home. In this sample, homeowner ages have a mean of 40 and standard deviation of 10. We want to use the bootstrap method to compute a confidence interval for the mean age of a homeowner in the population of all credit card applicants.

Suppose our computer is too slow to bootstrap 10,000 times, and instead can only bootstrap 20 times. Here are the 20 resample means, sorted in ascending order:
$$
\begin{align*}
    &37, 38, 39, 39, 40, 40, 40, 40, 41 , 41, \\
    &42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 43, 43, 43 , 44
\end{align*}
$$
What are the left and right endpoints of a bootstrapped **80%** confidence interval for the population mean? Use the mathematical definition of percentile.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Left endpoint = 38, Right endpoint = 43

To find an 80% confidence interval, we need to find the 10th and 90th percentiles of the resample means. Using the mathematical definiton of percentile, the 10th percentile is at position $0.1*20 = 2$ when we count starting with 1. Since 38 is the second element of the sorted data, that is the left endpoint of our confidence interval.

<average>63</average>
<br><br> 

Similarly, the 90th percentile is at position $0.9*20 = 18$ when we count starting with 1. Since  43 is the 18th element of the sorted data, that is the right endpoint of our confidence interval. 

<average>65</average>

True or False: Using the mathematical definition of percentile, the 50th percentile of the bootstrapped distribution above equals its median.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** False

The 50th percentile according to the mathematial definition is the element at position $0.5*20  10$ when we count starting with 1. The 10th element is 41. However, the median of a data set with 20 elements is halfway between the 10th and 11th values. So the median in this case is 41.5. 

<average>79</average>

Consider the following three quantities:

1. `pop_mean`, the unknown mean age of homeowners in the population of all credit card applicants. 

2. `sample_mean`, the mean age of homeowners in our sample of 500 applications in `apps`. We know this is 40.

3. `resample_mean`, the mean age of homeowners in one particular resample of the applications in `apps`.

Which of the following statements about the relationship between these three quantities are guaranteed to be true? Select all that apply.

[ ] If `sample_mean` is less than `pop_mean`, then `resample_mean` is also less than `pop_mean`.
[ ] The mean of `sample_mean` and `resample_mean` is closer to `pop_mean` than either of the two values individually. 
[ ] `resample_mean` is closer than `sample_mean` to `pop_mean`. 
[ ] `resample_mean` is further than `sample_mean` from `pop_mean`.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** None of the above.

Whenever we take a sample from a population, there is no guaranteed relationship between the mean of the sample and the mean of the population. Sometimes the mean of the sample comes out larger than the population mean, sometimes smaller. We know this from the CLT which says that the distribution of the sample mean is *centered* at the population mean. Similarly, when we resample from an original mean, the resample mean could be larger or smaller than the original sample's mean. The three quantities `pop_mean`, `sample_mean`, and `resample_mean` can be in any relative order. This means none of the statements listed here are necessarily true.

<average>37</average>
