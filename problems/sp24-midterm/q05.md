# BEGIN PROB

Arya's phone number has an interesting property: after the area code
(the first three digits), the remaining seven numbers of his phone
number consist of only two distinct digits.

Recall from the previous question that when the monkey dials a phone
number, each digit it selects is equally likely to be any of the digits
$0$ through $9$. Further, when the cat is dialing a phone number, it
makes sure to only use each digit once.

You're interested in estimating the probability that a phone number
dialed by the monkey or the cat has exactly two distinct digits after
the area code, like Arya's phone number. You write the following code,
which you plan to use for both the monkey and cat scenarios.

```py
    digits = np.arange(10)
    property_count = 0
    num_trials = 10000
    for i in np.arange(num_trials):
        after_area_code = __(x)__
        num_distinct = len(np.unique(after_area_code))
        if __(y)__:
            property_count = property_count + 1
    probability_estimate = property_count / num_trials
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

First, you want to estimate the probability that the **monkey** randomly
generates a number with only 2 distinct digits after the area code. What
code should be used to fill in blank `(x)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `np.random.choice(digits, 7, replace = True)` or `np.random.choice(digits, 7)`

The code simulates the monkey dialing seven digits where each digit is selected randomly from the digits 0 through 9, and digits can repeat `(replace = True)`.
<average>50</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Next, you want to estimate the probability that the **cat** randomly
generates a number with only 2 distinct digits after the area code. What
code should be used to fill in blank `(x)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `np.random.choice(digits, 7, replace = False)`

The code simulates random dialing by a cat without replacement `(replace = False)`. Each digit from 0 to 9 is used only once.
<average>52</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In either case, whether you're simulating the monkey or the cat, what
should be used to fill in blank `(y)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `num_distinct == 2`

This part of the code checks if the number of unique digits in the dialed number is exactly two.
<average>52</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

When you are simulating the **cat**, what will the value of
`probability_estimate` be after the code executes?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $0$

Since the cat dials each digit without replacement, it's impossible for the dialed number to contain only two distinct digits (as it would need to repeat some digits to achieve this). Thus, no trial will meet the condition `num_distinct == 2`, resulting in a property_count of 0 and therefore a probability_estimate of 0.
<average>53</average>
