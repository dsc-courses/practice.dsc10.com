Consider the histogram generated by the following code.

```py
contacts.plot(kind="hist", y="Day", density=True, bins=np.arange(1, 33))
```

Which of the following questions would you be able to answer from this
histogram? Select all that apply.

[ ] How many of your contacts were born on a Monday?
[ ] How many of your contacts were born on January 1st?
[ ] How many of your contacts were born on the first day of the month?
[ ] How many of your contacts were born on the last day of the month?

**Answer:** 

option 3: How many of your contacts were born on the first day of the month?

`contacts.plot(kind="hist", y="Day", density=True, bins=np.arange(1, 33))` generates a histogram that visualizes the distribution of values in the "Day" column of the contacts DataFrame. `bins=np.arange(1, 33)` creates the bins `[1,2], [2,3], ..., [31,32]`. Each bar in the histogram represents the density of a day. 

We can answer the question 'How many of your contacts were born on the first day of the month?' by checking the bar of day1.
Histogram doesn't contain information of day of the week or month, so it can't answer questions in option1 & 2.

we cannot choose option4, because we have month with 28 or 29 days(for February), 30 days, and 31 days in total. For day 31, we can know for sure it's the last day of the months, but with bars for 28, 29, 30, we won't be able to tell which portion are the last day of the month since months with 31 days will all contains these days.
