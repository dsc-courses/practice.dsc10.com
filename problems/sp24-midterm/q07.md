# BEGIN PROB

Recall from the data description that the `"DOB"` column in `contacts`
contains the date of birth of everyone in your contacts list, as a
string formatted like `"MM-DD-YYYY"`.

Looking at the calendar, you see that today's date is May 3rd, 2024,
which is `"05-03-2024"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Using today's date, fill in the blanks in the function `age_today` so
that the function takes as input someone's date of birth, as a string
formatted like `"MM-DD-YYYY"`, and returns that person's age, as of
today.

```py

    def age_today(dob):
        dob = dob.split("-")
        month = ___(a)___ # the month, as an int
        day = ___(b)___ # the day, as an int
        year = ___(c)___ # the year, as an int
        if ___(d)___:
            return 2024 - year
        return 2024 - year - 1
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

<average>61</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write a Python expression that evaluates to the average age of all of
your contacts, as of today.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`contacts.get("DOB").apply(age_today).mean()`

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
