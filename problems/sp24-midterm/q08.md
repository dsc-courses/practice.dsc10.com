# BEGIN PROB

You wonder if any of your friends have the same birthday, for example
two people both born on April 3rd. Fill in the blanks below so that the
given expression evaluates to the largest number of people in `contacts`
who share the same birthday.

**Note:** People do not need to be born in the same year to share a
birthday!

```py
contacts.groupby(___(a)___).___(b)___.get("Phone").___(c)___
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

- (a): `["Month", "Day"]`
- (b): `count()` 
- (c): `max()`

`.groupby(["Month", "Day"]).count()` groups the DataFrame contacts by each unique combination of 'Month' and 'Day' (birthday) and then counts the number of rows in each group (i.e. number of people born on that date). 

`.get('Phone')` gets a series which contains the counts of people born on each date, and `.max()` finds the largest number of people sharing the same birthday. 

<average>72</average>
