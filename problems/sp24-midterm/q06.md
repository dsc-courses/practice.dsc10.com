Suppose Charlie and Norah each have separate DataFrames for their
contacts, called `charlie` and `norah`, respectively. These DataFrames
have the same column names and format as your DataFrame, `contacts`.

As illustrated in the diagram below, Charlie has 172 contacts in total,
whereas Norah has 88 contacts. 12 of these contacts are shared, meaning
they appear in both `charlie` and `norah`.

What does the following expression evaluate to?

```py
charlie.merge(norah, left_index=True, right_index=True).shape[0]    
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

<average>4</average>

One day, when updating her phone's operating system, Norah accidentally
duplicates the 12 contacts she has in common with Charlie. Now, the
`norah` DataFrame has 100 rows.

What does the following expression evaluate to?

```py
norah.merge(norah, left_index=True, right_index=True).shape[0]   
``` 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

<average>4</average>

# END SOLUTION
