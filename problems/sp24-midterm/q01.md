Fill in the blanks in the function `sum_phone` below. This function
should take as input a string representing a phone number, given in the
form `"xxx-xxx-xxxx"`, and return the sum of the digits of that phone
number, as an `int`.

For example, `sum_phone("501-800-3002")` should evaluate to `19`.


```py
     def sum_phone(phone_number):
        total = 0
        for digit in phone_number:
            if ___(a)___:
                ___(b)___ 
        return total
```
