# BEGIN PROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `sum_phone` below. This function
should take as input a string representing a phone number, given in the
form `"xxx-xxx-xxxx"`, and return the sum of the digits of that phone
number, as an `int`.

For example, `sum_phone("501-800-3002")` should evaluate to `19`.


```py
     def sum_phone(phone_number):
        total = 0
        for digit in phone_number:
            if ___(a)___:
                ___(b)___ 
        return total
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- (a): `digit != "-"`
  - checks if the current character is not a hyphen. This is because hyphens are not digits and should not be included in the sum.

- (b): `total = total + int(digit)`
  - converts the current character to an integer and adds it to the total sum if the character is a digit.

<average>53</average>
