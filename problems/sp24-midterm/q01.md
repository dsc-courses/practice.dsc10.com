# BEGIN PROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `sum_phone` below. This function
should take as input a string representing a phone number, given in the
form `"xxx-xxx-xxxx"`, and return the sum of the digits of that phone
number, as an `int`.

For example, `sum_phone("501-800-3002")` should evaluate to `19`.


```py
     def sum_phone(phone_number):
        total = 0
        for digit in phone_number:
            if ___(a)___:
                ___(b)___ 
        return total
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- **\(a\) `digit != "-"`**
- **\(b\) `total = total + int(digit)`**

(a) We only care if the current `digit` is a number, and the only character in the string of the `phone_number` is the hyphen (`-`). For instance, in the given phone number of `"501-800-3002"`, we want to extract the actual numbers in the string, without the hyphens. So, because we cannot establish a numerical value to a hyphen, we exclude it.

<average>34</average>

(b) This converts the current character to an integer and adds it to the total sum if the character is a digit.

<average>71</average>
