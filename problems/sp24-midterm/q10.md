After looking at the distribution of `"Day"` for your contacts, you
wonder how that distribution might look for other groups of people.

In this problem, we will consider the distribution of day of birth (just
the day of the month, not the month or year) for all babies born in the
year 2023, under the assumption that all babies born in 2023 were
equally likely to be born on each of the 365 days of the year.

The density histogram below shows this distribution.

**Note:** 2023 was not a leap year, so February had 28 days.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is height `(a)`?

( ) $\dfrac{1}{28}$ 
( ) $\dfrac{28}{365}$ 
( ) $\dfrac{12 \cdot 28}{365}$
( ) $\dfrac{1}{12}$ 
( ) $\dfrac{12}{365}$ 
( ) $1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

<average>38</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Express height `(b)` in terms of height `(a)`.

( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{7}{12} \cdot$ `(a)`
( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{27}{28} \cdot$ `(a)`
( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{28}{29} \cdot$ `(a)`
( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{11}{12} \cdot$ `(a)`
( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{7}{11} \cdot$ `(a)`
( ) `(b)` = $\dfrac{12 \cdot 28}{365} \cdot$ `(a)`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

<average>43</average>
