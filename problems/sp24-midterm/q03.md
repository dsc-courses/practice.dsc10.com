# BEGIN PROB

Write a Python expression that evaluates to a DataFrame of only your
contacts whose phone numbers end in `"6789"`.

**Note:** Do not use slicing, if you know what that is. You must use
methods from this course.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `contacts[contacts.get("Phone").str.contains("6789")]` or `contacts[contacts.get("Phone").str.contains("-6789")]`

- `contacts.get("Phone")`: retrieves the `"Phone"` column from the contacts DataFrame as a Series.
- `.str.contains("6789")`: applies a string method that checks for the presence of the substring `"6789"` in each phone number, which could only present in the end of the phone number. It returns a Boolean Series indicating True for phone numbers containing this substring.
- `contacts[...]`: retrieve all rows where the condition is True.
