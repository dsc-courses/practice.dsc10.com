# BEGIN PROB

The first contact in `contacts` is your friend Calvin, who has an
interesting phone number, with all the digits in descending order:
987-654-3210. Fill in the blanks below so that each expression evaluates
to the sum of the digits in Calvin's phone number.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

    contacts.get("Phone").apply(sum_phone).iloc[___(a)___]

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `0`

\(a\) should be filled with `0` because `.iloc[0]` refers to the first item in a Series, which corresponds to Calvin.

<average>89</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

    sum_phone(contacts.get("Phone").loc[___(b)___])

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `"Calvin"`

\(b\) should be filled with `"Calvin"` because `.loc[]` accesses an element of Series by its row label. In this case, `"Calvin"` is the index label of the Series element that contains Calvin's phone number.

<average>84</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

    np.arange(__(c)__,__(d)__,__(e)__).sum() 

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- (c): `0` or alternate solution `9`

- (d): `10` or alternate solution `-1`

- (e): `1` or alternate solution `-1`

The expression uses `np.arange()` to generate a range of numbers and then sums them up. From the problem, we can see that Calvin's phone number includes every digit from 9 to 0, so summing this is equivalent to summing the digits from 9 down to 0 or from 0 to 9.

`np.arange(0, 10, 1)` generates [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Alternatively, using the numbers in descending order (like the digits in Calvin's phone number): `np.arange(9, -1, -1)` generates [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. Both correctly sum up to 45.

<average>74</average>
