Oh no! A monkey has grabbed your phone and is dialing a phone number by
randomly pressing buttons on the keypad, such that each button pressed
is equally likely to be any of ten digits 0 through 9.

The monkey managed to dial a ten-digit number and call that number. What
is the probability that the monkey calls one of your contacts? Give your
answer as a Python expression, using the DataFrame `contacts`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(contacts.shape[0])/(10**10)`

<average>44</average>

Now, your cat is stepping carefully across the keypad of your phone,
pressing 10 buttons. Each button is sampled randomly **without
replacement** from the digits 0 through 9.

You catch your cat in the act of dialing, when the cat has already
dialed 987-654. Based on this information, what is the probability that
the cat dials your friend Calvin's number, 987-654-3210? Give your
answer as an unsimplified mathematical expression.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$\dfrac{1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$

<average>64</average>
