Oh no! A monkey has grabbed your phone and is dialing a phone number by
randomly pressing buttons on the keypad, such that each button pressed
is equally likely to be any of ten digits 0 through 9.

The monkey managed to dial a ten-digit number and call that number. What
is the probability that the monkey calls one of your contacts? Give your
answer as a Python expression, using the DataFrame `contacts`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `(contacts.shape[0])/(10**10)`

- `contacts.shape[0]`: retrieves the number of rows in the contacts DataFrame, representing the total number of phone numbers you have stored in your contacts.
- `10**10`: Since the phone number consists of ten digits, and each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, there are a total of `10**10` possible ten-digit numbers.

Given that each digit pressed is equally likely and independent of others, the likelihood of hitting a specific number from your contacts by random chance is simply the count of your contacts divided by the total number of possible combinations (which is `10**10`).

Now, your cat is stepping carefully across the keypad of your phone,
pressing 10 buttons. Each button is sampled randomly **without
replacement** from the digits 0 through 9.

You catch your cat in the act of dialing, when the cat has already
dialed 987-654. Based on this information, what is the probability that
the cat dials your friend Calvin's number, 987-654-3210? Give your
answer as an unsimplified mathematical expression.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\dfrac{1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$

The cat has already dialed "987-654". Since the first six digits are fixed and chosen without replacement, the only remaining digits to be dialed are 3, 2, 1, and 0. The sequence "3210" must be dialed in that exact order from the remaining digits.

- The probability of dialing '3' first is $\dfrac{1}{4}$ (4 digits are remaining).
- The probability of then dialing '2' next is $\dfrac{1}{3}$ (3 digits are remaining).
- The probability of then dialing '1' next is $\dfrac{1}{2}$ (2 digits are remaining).
- The probability of lastly dialing '0' is $\dfrac{1}{1}$ (as it's the only digit left).

The product of these probabilities gives $\dfrac{1}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}$, representing the likelihood of this specific sequence occurring.
