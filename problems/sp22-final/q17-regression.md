Suppose the price of an IKEA product and the cost to have it assembled are linearly associated with a correlation of 0.8. Product prices have a mean of 140 dollars and a standard deviation of 40 dollars. Assembly costs have a mean of 80 dollars and a standard deviation of 10 dollars. We want to predict the assembly cost of a product based on its price using linear regression.
