# BEGIN PROB

For each IKEA desk, we know the cost of producing the desk, in dollars, and the current sale price of the desk, in dollars. We want to predict sale price based on production cost using linear regression. 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

For this scenario, which of the following most likely describes the slope of the regression line when both variables are measured in dollars?

( ) less than 0
( ) between 0 and 1, exclusive
( ) more than 1
( ) none of the above (exactly equal to 0 or 1)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** more than 1

For this scenario, which of the following most likely describes the slope of the regression line when both variables are measured in standard units?

( ) less than 0
( ) between 0 and 1, exclusive
( ) more than 1
( ) none of the above (exactly equal to 0 or 1)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** between 0 and 1, exclusive

What is being represented on the horizontal axis of the residual plot?

( ) actual production cost
( ) actual sale price
( ) predicted production cost
( ) predicted sale price

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** actual production cost

Which of the following is a correct conclusion based on this residual plot? Select all that apply.

[ ] The correlation between production cost and sale price is weak.
[ ] It would be better to fit a nonlinear curve.
[ ] Our predictions will be more accurate for some inputs than others.
[ ] We don't have enough data to do regression.
[ ] The regression line is not the best-fitting line for this data set.
[ ] The data set is not representative of the population.
