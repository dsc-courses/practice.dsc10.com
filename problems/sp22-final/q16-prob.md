# BEGIN PROB

The HAUGA bedroom furniture set includes two items, a bed frame and a bedside table. Suppose the amount of time it takes someone to assemble the bed frame is a random quantity drawn from the probability distribution below.

<center>
<table class="table" style="width:30%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Time to assemble bed frame</th>
      <th scope="col">Probability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">10 minutes</th>
      <td>0.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">20 minutes</th>
      <td>0.4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">30 minutes</th>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

Similarly, the time it takes someone to assemble the bedside table is a random quantity, independent of the time it takes them to assemble the bed frame, drawn from the probability distribution below.

<center>
<table class="table" style="width:30%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Time to assemble bedside table</th>
      <th scope="col">Probability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">30 minutes</th>
      <td>0.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">40 minutes</th>
      <td>0.4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">50 minutes</th>
      <td>0.3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
