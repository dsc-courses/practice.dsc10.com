Suppose you have correctly implemented the function \texttt{area\_between(x, y)} so that it returns the area under the armchair curve between \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, assuming the inputs satisfy \texttt{-4 <= x <= y <= 12}. 

\textbf{Note:} You can still do this question, even if you didn't know how to do the previous one.
