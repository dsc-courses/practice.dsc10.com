Billina Records, a new record company focused on creating new TikTok audios, has its offices on the 23rd floor of a skyscraper with 75 floors (numbered 1 through 75). The owners of the building promised that 10 different random floors will be selected to be renovated.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Below, fill in the blanks to complete a simulation that will estimate the probability that Billina Records' floor will be renovated. 

```py
total = 0
repetitions = 10000
for i in np.arange(repetitions):
    choices = np.random.choice(__(a)__, 10, __(b)__)
    if __(c)__:
        total = total + 1
prob_renovate = total / repetitions
```

What goes in blank (a)?

( ) `np.arange(1, 75)`
( ) `np.arange(10, 75)`
( ) `np.arange(0, 76)`
( ) `np.arange(1, 76)`

What goes in blank (b)?

( ) `replace=True`
( ) `replace=False`

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `choices == 23`
( ) `choices is 23`
( ) `np.count_nonzero(choices == 23) > 0`
( ) `np.count_nonzero(choices) == 23`
( ) `choices.str.contains(23)`

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** `np.arange(1, 76)`, `replace=False`, `np.count_nonzero(choices == 23) > 0`

Here, the idea is to randomly choose 10 **different** floors repeatedly, and each time, check if floor 23 was selected.

Blank (a): The first argument to `np.random.choice` needs to be an array/list containing the options we want to choose from, i.e. an array/list containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 75, since those are the numbers of the floors. `np.arange(a, b)` returns an array of integers spaced out by 1 starting from `a` and ending at `b-1`. As such, the correct call to `np.arange` is `np.arange(1, 76)`.

Blank (b): Since we want to select 10 different floors, we need to specify `replace=False` (the default behavior is `replace=True`).

Blank (c): The `if` condition needs to check if 23 was one of the 10 numbers that were selected, i.e. if 23 is in `choices`. It needs to evaluate to a single Boolean value, i.e. `True` (if 23 was selected) or `False` (if 23 was not selected). Let's go through each incorrect option to see why it's wrong:

- Option 1, `choices == 23`, does not evaluate to a single Boolean value; rather, it evaluates to an array of length 10, containing multiple `True`s and `False`s.
- Option 2, `choices is 23`, does not evaluate to what we want â€“ it checks to see if the array `choices` is the same Python object as the number 23, which it is not (and will never be, since an array cannot be a single number).
- Option 4, `np.count_nonzero(choices) == 23`, does evaluate to a single Boolean, however it is not quite correct. `np.count_nonzero(choices)` will always evaluate to 10, since `choices` is made up of 10 integers randomly selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 75, none of which are 0. As such, `np.count_nonzero(choices) == 23` is the same as `10 == 23`, which is always False, regardless of whether or not 23 is in `choices`.
- Option 5, `choices.str.contains(23)`, errors, since `choices` is not a Series (and `.str` can only follow a Series). If `choices` were a Series, this would still error, since the argument to `.str.contains` must be a string, not an int.

By process of elimination, Option 3, `np.count_nonzero(choices == 23) > 0`, must be the correct answer. Let's look at it piece-by-piece:

- As we saw in Option 1, `choices == 23` is a Boolean array that contains `True` each time the selected floor was floor 23 and `False` otherwise. (Since we're sampling without replacement, floor 23 can only be selected at most once, and so `choices == 23` can only contain the value `True` at most once.)
- `np.count_nonzero(choices == 23)` evaluates to the number of `True`s in `choices == 23`. If it is positive (i.e. 1), it means that floor 23 was selected. If it is 0, it means floor 23 was not selected.
- Thus, `np.count_nonzero(choices == 23) > 0` evaluates to `True` if (and only if) floor 23 was selected.

In the previous subpart of this question, your answer to blank (c) contained the number 23, and the simulated probability was stored in the variable `prob_renovate`.

Suppose, in blank (c), we change the number 23 to the number 46, and we store the new simulated probability in the variable name `other_prob`. (`prob_renovate` is unchanged from the previous part.) 

With these changes, which of the following is the most accurate representation of the relationship between `other_prob` and `prob_renovate`?

( ) `other_prob` will be roughly half of `prob_renovate`
( ) `other_prob` will be roughly equal to `prob_renovate`
( ) `other_prob` will be roughly double `prob_renovate`

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** `other_prob` will be roughly equal to `prob_renovate`

The calculation we did in the previous subpart was not specific to the number 23. That is, we could have replaced 23 with any integer between 1 and 75 inclusive and the simulation would have been just as valid. The probability we estimated is the probability that **any one floor** was randomly selected; there is nothing special about 23.

(We say "roughly equal" because the result may turn out slightly different due to randomness.)
