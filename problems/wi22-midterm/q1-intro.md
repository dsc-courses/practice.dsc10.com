# BEGIN PROB

Below, identify the data type of the result of each of the following expressions, or select "error" if you believe the expression results in an error.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
sky.sort_values('height')
```

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean
( ) string
( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** DataFrame

`sky` is a DataFrame. All the `sort_values` method does is change the order of the rows in the Series/DataFrame it is called on, it does not change the data structure. As such, `sky.sort_values('height')` is also a DataFrame.

( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** error

`sky.sort_values('height')` is a DataFrame, and `sky.sort_values('height').get('material')` is a Series corresponding to the `'material'` column, sorted by `'height'` in increasing order. So far, there are no errors.

Remember, the `.loc` _accessor_ is used to access elements in a Series based on their index. `sky.sort_values('height').get('material').loc[0]` is asking for the element in the `sky.sort_values('height').get('material')` Series with index 0. However, the index of `sky` is made up of building names. Since there is no building named `0`,  `.loc[0]` causes an error.

( ) int or float

( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** string

As we mentioned above, `sky.sort_values('height').get('material')` is a Series containing values from the `'material'` column (but sorted). Remember, there is no element in this Series with an index of 0, so `sky.sort_values('height').get('material').loc[0]` errors. However, `.iloc[0]` works differently than `.loc[0]`; `.iloc[0]` will give us the first element in a Series (independent of what's in the index). So, `sky.sort_values('height').get('material').iloc[0]` gives us back a value from the `'material'` column, which is made up of strings, so it gives us a string. (Specifically, it gives us the `'material'` type of the skyscraper with the smallest `'height'`.)

```py
sky.get('city').apply(len)
```

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean
( ) string
( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** Series

The `.apply` method takes in a function and evaluates that function on every element in a Series. Here, `sky.get('city').apply(len)` is using the function `len` on every element in the Series `sky.get('city')`. The result is also a Series, containing the lengths of the names of each `'city'`.

```py
sky.get('city').apply(max)
```

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean
( ) string
( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** Series

This is a tricky problem!

The function that `apply` takes in must work on individual elements in a Series, i.e. it must work with just a single argument. We saw this in the above subpart, where `sky.get('city').apply(len)` applied `len` on each `'city'` name.

Here, we are trying to apply the `max` function on each `'city'` name. The `max` of a single item does not work in Python, because taking the `max` requires comparing two or more elements. Try it out - in a notebook, run the expression `max(5)`, and you'll see an error. So, if we tried to use `.apply(max)` on a Series of numbers, we'd run into an error.

**However**, we are using `.apply(max)` on a Series of strings, and it turns out that Python **does** allow us to take the `max` of a string! The `max` of a string in Python is defined as the last character in the string alphabetically, so `max('hello')` evaluates to `'o'`. This means that `sky.get('city').apply(max)` does actually run without error; it evaluates to a Series containing the last element in the name of each `'city'`.

(This subpart was trickier than we intended â€“ we ended up giving credit to both "error" and "Series".)

```py
sky.get('floors').max()
```

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean
( ) string
( ) array
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** int or float

The Series `sky.get('floors')` is made up of integers, and `sky.get('floors').max()` evaluates to the largest number in the Series, which is also an integer.

```py
sky.groupby('material').max()

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean

( ) Series
( ) DataFrame
( ) error

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** DataFrame

When grouping and using an aggregation method, the result is always a DataFrame. The DataFrame `sky.groupby('material').max()` contains all of the columns in `sky`, minus `'material'`, which has been moved to the index. It contains one row for each unique `'material'`.

Note that no columns were "dropped", as may happen when using `.mean()`, because `.max()` can work on Series' of any type. You can take the max of strings, while you cannot take the mean of strings.

```py
sky.index[0]
```

( ) int or float
( ) Boolean

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer:** string

`sky.index` contains the values `'Bayard-Condict Building'`, `'The Yacht Club at Portofino'`, `'City Investing Building'`, etc. `sky.index[0]` is then `'Bayard-Condict Building'`, which is a string.
