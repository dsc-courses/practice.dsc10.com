# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we plot a density histogram showing the distribution of the
`"Degrees"` column in `uc`, using the argument
`bins=np.arange(0, uc.get("Degrees").max() + 3000, 2000)` .

Suppose there are 12 rows of `uc` corresponding to campuses and years in
which fewer than 2000 degrees were awarded. How tall will the first bar
in the histogram be? Give your answer as an **exact decimal or
simplified fraction**.
