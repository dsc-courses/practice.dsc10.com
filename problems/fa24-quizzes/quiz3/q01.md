The DataFrame `space_reptiles` contains 1000 rows of information about
**all** space reptiles living on Statistica, which we'll think of as a
population. For each reptile, we have its `"length"` in meters, `"age"`
in years, and `"number_of_eyes"`. The first five rows of
`space_reptiles` are shown below.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the `sample_of_reptiles` function. The function
has two parameters, `"sample_size" (int)`, which will be a positive
integer, and `"column" (str)`, which will be the name of one of the
columns in `space_reptiles`. The function should take a sample of
reptiles from `space_reptiles`, **with replacement**, of the specified
size, and return the average value in the given column for the sample.

    def sample_of_reptiles(sample_size, column):
        return space_reptiles.sample(__(x)__).__(y)__    

`x`:\
`y`:

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**:  
`x`: sample_size, replace=True

`y`: get(column).mean()

<average>85</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The function call `sample_of_reptiles(1000, "length")` is
an example of **bootstrapping**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: False

<average>77</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Calculate the **variance** of the data in the first five rows of the
`"number_of_eyes"` column of `space_reptiles`: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Give your
answer as an **integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: 8

<average>50</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the next row in the `"number_of_eyes"` column contains 6. If we
add this value to our dataset and then recompute the variance, it
would\...

( ) decrease because the new value is less than the greatest value
    in the data set.
( ) decrease because the new value is equal to the mean.
( ) remain the same because the new value is equal to the median.
( ) increase because the data set has more values than it did
    before.
( ) increase because the new value is a positive number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: decrease because the new value is equal to the mean.

<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
