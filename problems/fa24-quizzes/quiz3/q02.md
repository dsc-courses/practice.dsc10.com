Statistica's forests are filled with tall creatures called
whingdingdillies. You have a large random sample of 400
whingdingdillies. In this sample, the mean height is 30m and the
standard deviation is 4m. Suppose that whingdingdilly heights are
normally distributed.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What are the endpoints of a CLT-based 95% confidence interval for the
mean height of whingdingdillies? Each value should be a single number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: left endpoint = 29.6, right endpoint = 30.4

<average>50</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Determine the values of the variables `v` and `w` in the code below so
that `wdd_prop` evaluates to the approximate proportion of
whingdingdillies with heights between 30m and 33m. Each value should
be a single number.

    wdd_prop = stats.norm.cdf(v) - stats.norm.cdf(w)


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: v = .75, w = 0

<average>52</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Above, we stated an assumption that whingdingdilly heights are normally
distributed. For which part(s) of this question did we **need** that
assumption?

( ) 2.1 only 
( ) 2.2 only 
( ) both 2.1 and 2.2 
( ) neither 2.1 nor 2.2

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: 2.2 only

<average>57</average>

# END SOLUTION

After a frightening encounter, you discover that whingdingdillies can
run very fast. You collect a sample of 400 whingdingdilly speeds, then
use this sample to generate a bootstrapped distribution of resample mean
speeds. Afterwards, you wonder how your bootstrapped distribution would
have looked if you had instead been able to collect a random sample of
size 900. Which of the following overlaid histograms shows two
bootstrapped distributions of resample mean speeds, based on samples of
size 400 and 900?
