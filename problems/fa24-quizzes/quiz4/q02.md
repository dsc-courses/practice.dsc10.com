# BEGIN PROB

Consider the following pair of hypotheses:

-   **Null:** The proportion of `"Comedy"` movies with an average rating
    above 9 **equals** the proportion of `"Action"` movies with a rating
    above 9.

-   **Alternative:** The proportion of `"Comedy"` movies with an average
    rating above 9 is **greater than** the proportion of `"Action"`
    movies with a rating above 9.

Let $C_9$ be the proportion of `"Comedy"` movies with a rating above 9
and let $A_9$ be the proportion of `"Action"` movies with a rating above
9. Which of the following are valid test statistics to test these
hypotheses? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] $C_9$ - 0.5
[ ] $A_9$ - 0.5
[ ] $A_9 \cdot C_9$
[ ] $A_9 + C_9$
[ ] $C_9 - A_9$
[ ] $A_9 - C_9$
[ ] $|A_9 - C_9|$
[ ] $|C_9 - A_9|$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $C_9 - A_9$ and $A_9 - C_9$

<average>82</average>
# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
