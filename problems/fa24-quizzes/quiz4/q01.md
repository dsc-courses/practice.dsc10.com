# BEGIN PROB

We plan to collect a sample of movies and use this sample to estimate
the proportion of all movies with the genre `"Musical"`, a population
parameter.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If we want to create a $95\%$ confidence interval that is at most $0.08$
wide, which of the expressions below represents the smallest sample size
we should collect?

( ) $\left(\dfrac{1}{0.02}\right)^2$ 
( ) $\left(\dfrac{1}{0.04}\right)^2$ 
( ) $\left(\dfrac{1}{0.08}\right)^2$ 
( ) $\left(\dfrac{1}{0.16}\right)^2$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $\left(\dfrac{1}{0.04}\right)^2$ 

<average>41</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $W$ represent the maximum width of a $95\%$ confidence interval
obtained from a sample that is **twice as big** as the sample size you
found in part (a). Which of the following is true?

( ) $0 < W < 0.04$ 
( ) $W = 0.04$ 
( ) $0.04 < W < 0.08$ 
( ) $W \geq 0.08$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: $0.04 < W < 0.08$ 

<average>56</average>

# END SOLUTION
