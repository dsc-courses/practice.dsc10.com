# BEGIN PROB

Suppose that in `movies`, the average rating of `"Action"` movies is 7.4
and the average rating of `"Horror"` movies is 7.2. Based on this data,
we decide to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null**: The ratings of `"Action"` and `"Horror"` movies come from
    the same distribution.

-   **Alternative**: On average, `"Action"` movies have a higher rating
    `"Horror"` movies.

We'll use as our test statistic the mean rating of `"Action"` movies
minus the mean rating of `"Horror"` movies.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so the code below generates 5000 simulated values of
this test statistic and calculates the p-value of our test.

    def one_stat(df):
        group_means = df.groupby("New").mean().get("Rating")
        return group_means.loc[__(a)__] - group_mean.loc[__(b)__]

    action_horror = movies[(movies.get("Genre") == "Action") | 
                           (movies.get("Genre") == "Horror")]
    diffs = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(5000):
        new_df = action_horror.assign(New = __(c)__)
        diffs = np.append(diffs, __(d)__)

    p_value = np.count_nonzero( __(e)__ ) / 5000

# BEGIN SOLUTION
- (a): `"Action"`
- (b): `"Horror"`
- (c): `np.random.permutation(action horror.get("Genre"))`
- (d): `one stat(new df)`
- (e): `diffs >= 0.2`

<average>74</average>

# END SOLUTION

Suppose that `p_value` evaluates to $0.14$. Using the standard p-value
cutoff of $0.05$, which of the two hypotheses is better supported by the
data?

( ) Null 
( ) Alternative

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Null
<average>84</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

What kind of hypothesis test did we perform in this question?

( ) Standard hypothesis test 
( ) Permutation test

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Permutation test
<average>84</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
