# BEGIN PROB

Suppose that `weights` is an array containing the weights, in kilograms,
of several leopard sharks living in La Jolla Cove. Several leopard
sharks represented in `weights` weigh more than 10 kilograms.

Suppose that we have imported a module called `sharkpy` by running the
code `import sharkpy`. The `sharkpy` module includes a function `heavy`
that takes as input an array of shark weights and returns a smaller
array containing only the weights that are above 10 kilograms.

**Using the `heavy` function and an array method of your choice**, write
an expression that evaluates to the weight, in kilograms, of the
lightest leopard shark in `weights` that weighs more than 10 kilograms.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `sharkpy.heavy(weights).min()`

<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
