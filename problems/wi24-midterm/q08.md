The histogram below shows the distribution of game times in minutes for
both two-player and three-player games of *Clue*, with each distribution
representing 1000 games played.

How many **more** three-player games than two-player games took at least
50 minutes to play? Give your answer as an **integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 80
<br>
We need to find the number of three player games that took at least 50 minutes to play compared to two player games. We do this by multiplying 1000 by the proportion of the distribution taken up by at least 50 minutes, which is 14% in the three player distribution and 6% in the two player distribution. This means the difference would be $1000 \cdot 0.14 - 1000 \cdot 0.06 = 80$

<average>61</average>

Calculate the approximate area of overlap of the two histograms. Give
your answer as a **proportion between 0 and 1, rounded to two decimal places**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.74
<br>
To find the area of overlap of the two histograms, we take only one of the distributions and see how much of its area overlaps with the other distribution. Let's use the two player distribution:
<br>

-   From 10-20: 0.06

-   From 20-30: 0.18

-   From 30-40: 0.28

-   From 40-50: 0.16

-   From 50-60: 0.06
<br>

The summation of the overlap here is $0.74$!
<average>56</average>
