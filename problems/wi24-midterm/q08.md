The histogram below shows the distribution of game times in minutes for
both two-player and three-player games of *Clue*, with each distribution
representing 1000 games played.

How many **more** three-player games than two-player games took at least
50 minutes to play? Give your answer as an **integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 80

First, calculate the number of three-player games that took at least 50 minutes. We can calculate this number by multiplying the area of that particular histogram bar (from 50 to 60) by the total number of three player games(1000 games) total. This results in $(60-50) \cdot 0.014 \cdot 1000 = 140$. We repeat the same process to find the number of two-player games that took at least 50 minutes, which is $(60-50) \cdot 0.006 \cdot 1000 = 60$. Then, we find the difference of these numbers, which is $140 - 60 = 80$.

An easier way to calculate this is to measure the difference directly. We could do this by finding the area of the highlighted region below and then multiplying by the number of games. This represents the difference between the number of three-player games and the number of two player games. This, way we need to do just one calculation to get the same answer: $(60 - 50) \cdot (0.014 - 0.006) \cdot 1000 = 80$.

Calculate the approximate area of overlap of the two histograms. Give
your answer as a **proportion between 0 and 1, rounded to two decimal places**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.74

To find the area of overlap of the two histograms, we can directly calculate the area of overlap in each bin and add them up as shown below. However, this requires a lot of calculation, and is not advised. 

-   From 10-20: $(20-10) \cdot 0.006 = 0.06$

-   From 20-30: $(30-20) \cdot 0.018 = 0.18$

-   From 30-40: $(40-30) \cdot 0.028 = 0.28$

-   From 40-50: $(50-40) \cdot 0.016 = 0.16$

-   From 50-60: $(60-50) \cdot 0.006 = 0.06$


The summation of the overlap here is $0.74$!

A much more efficient way to do this problem is to find the area of overlap by taking the total area of one distribution (which is 1) and subtracting the area in that distribution that does not overlap with the other. In the picture below, the only area in the two-player distribution that does not overlap with three-player distribution is highlighted. Notice there are only two regions to find the area of, so this is much easier. The calculation comes out the same: $1 - ((20 - 10) \cdot (0.022-0.006) + (30 - 20) \cdot (0.028 - 0.018) = 0.74$.
