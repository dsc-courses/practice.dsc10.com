The histogram below shows the distribution of game times in minutes for
both two-player and three-player games of *Clue*, with each distribution
representing 1000 games played.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many **more** three-player games than two-player games took at least
50 minutes to play? Give your answer as an **integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 80
<br>
First, calculate the number of three-player games that took at least 50 minutes, which is 140. Then, find the number of two-player games that at least 50 minutes, which is 60. Then, find the difference of the numbers, which is 80! An easier way to calculate this is to measure the difference directly. That is measure the area of the line highlighted region shown below!

Calculate the approximate area of overlap of the two histograms. Give
your answer as a **proportion between 0 and 1, rounded to two decimal places**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.74
<br>
To find the area of overlap of the two histograms, we take only one of the distributions and see how much of its area overlaps with the other distribution. Let's use the two player distribution:
<br>

-   From 10-20: 0.06

-   From 20-30: 0.18

-   From 30-40: 0.28

-   From 40-50: 0.16

-   From 50-60: 0.06
<br>
The summation of the overlap here is $0.74$!
<br>
Another easier way to look at this problem is to find the area is not overlap and do 1 minus that area! Here is an example of the non overlapping area below.
