# BEGIN PROB

When someone is ready to make an accusation, they make a statement such
as:

*"It was Miss Scarlett with the dagger in the study\"*

While the suspect, weapon, and room may be different, an accusation will
always have this form:

*"It was \_\_\_\_\_\_ with the \_\_\_\_\_\_ in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\"*

Suppose the array `words` is defined as follows (note the spaces).
```py
    words = np.array(["It was ", " with the ", " in the "])
```
Suppose another array called `answers` has been defined. `answers`
contains three elements: the name of the suspect, weapon, and room that
we would like to use in our accusation, in that order. Using `words` and
`answers`, complete the `for`-loop below so that `accusation` is a
string, formatted as above, that represents our accusation.
```py
    accusation = ""
    for i in ___(a)___:
        accusation = ___(b)___
```
