Recall that the game *Clue* comes with 22 cards, one for each of the 6
suspects, 7 weapons, and 9 rooms. One suspect card, one weapon card, and
one room card are chosen randomly, without being looked at, and placed
aside in an envelope. The remaining 19 cards (5 suspects, 6 weapons, 8
rooms) are randomly shuffled and dealt out, splitting them as evenly as
possible among the players. Suppose in a three-player game, Janine gets
6 cards, which are dealt one at a time.

Answer the probability questions that follow. Leave your answers
**unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Cards are dealt one at a time. What is the probability that the first
card Janine is dealt is a weapon card?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{6}{19}$

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that all 6 of Janine's cards are weapon cards?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{6}{19} \cdot \frac{5}{18} \cdot \frac{4}{17} \cdot \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{2}{15} \cdot \frac{1}{14}$

<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Determine the probability that exactly one of the first two cards Janine
is dealt is a weapon card. This probability can be expressed in the form
$$\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{m \cdot (m + 1)}$$ where $k$ and $m$ are
**integers**. What are the values of $k$ and $m$?

**Hint**: There is no need for any sort of calculation that you can't do
easily in your head, such as long division or multiplication.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $k$ = 12, $m$ = 18

<average>31</average>

# END SOLUTION
