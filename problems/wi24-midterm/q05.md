Recall that the game *Clue* comes with 22 cards, one for each of the 6
suspects, 7 weapons, and 9 rooms. One suspect card, one weapon card, and
one room card are chosen randomly, without being looked at, and placed
aside in an envelope. The remaining 19 cards (5 suspects, 6 weapons, 8
rooms) are randomly shuffled and dealt out, splitting them as evenly as
possible among the players. Suppose in a three-player game, Janine gets
6 cards, which are dealt one at a time.

Answer the probability questions that follow. Leave your answers
**unsimplified**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Cards are dealt one at a time. What is the probability that the first
card Janine is dealt is a weapon card?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{6}{19}$

The probability of getting a certain card is the the $\frac{num\_card\_c}{num\_card\_all}$ where `num_card_c` is the number of a certain card and `num_card_all` is the amount of all the cards we have. There are 6 `"weapon"` cards and 19 cards total, so the probability has to be $\frac{6}{19}$. It does not matter how the cards were dealt. Though each card is dealt one at a time to each player, Janine will always end up with six out of the 19 cards available. The first card she receives is from the pool of 19 cards available with 6 of them being weapon cards, even if she was dealt to last.

What is the probability that all 6 of Janine's cards are weapon cards?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{6}{19} \cdot \frac{5}{18} \cdot \frac{4}{17} \cdot \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{2}{15} \cdot \frac{1}{14}$

The probability of getting Janine getting all the weapon cards is the  probability of getting a dealt a `"weapon"` card first multiplied by the probability of getting a weapon card second multiplied by continuing probabilities of getting a weapon card until probability of getting a weapon card on the sixth draw. The denominator of each subsequent probability decreases by 1 because we remove one card from the total number of cards on each draw. The numerator also decreases by 1 because we remove a `"weapon"` card from the total number of `"weapon"` on each draw.

Determine the probability that exactly one of the first two cards Janine
is dealt is a weapon card. This probability can be expressed in the form
$$\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{m \cdot (m + 1)}$$ where $k$ and $m$ are
**integers**. What are the values of $k$ and $m$?

**Hint**: There is no need for any sort of calculation that you can't do
easily in your head, such as long division or multiplication.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $k$ = 12, $m$ = 18

$m$ has to be 18 because the denominator is the number of cards available during the first and second draw. We have 19 cards on the first draw and 18 on the second draw, so the only way to get that is for $m$ = 18. 

Both terms in the sum are the same, so it is the double of one terms. Then, you can combine the factor of 2 draws with the factor of 6 weapons to get 12 for $k$. 

<!-- The probability that exactly one of the cards of your first two draws is a weapon card can be broken down into two cases: the probability of getting a weapon card first and then another card, the probability of getting another card first and then a weapon card. This is $\frac{6 \cdot 13}{19 \cdot 18}$ + $\frac{13 \cdot 6}{19 \cdot 18}$. The numerator of this fraction ends up being 156! The only $k$ value where $k$($k$+1) = 156 is 12! -->
