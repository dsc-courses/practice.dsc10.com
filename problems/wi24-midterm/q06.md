# BEGIN PROB

Which of the following probabilities could most easily be approximated
by writing a simulation in Python? Select the best answer.

( ) The probability that Janine wins the game.
( ) The probability that a three-player game takes less than 30 minutes to play.
( ) The probability that Janine has three or more suspect cards.
( ) The probability that Janine visits the kitchen at some point in the game.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The probability that Janine has three or more suspect cards.
<br>
Let's explain each choice and why they would be easy or difficult to simulate in Python. The **first choice** is difficult because these simulations depend on Janine's strategies and decisions in the game. There is no way to simulate people's choices. We can only simulate randomness For the **second choice**, we are not given information on how long the game takes or a distribution of times for games, so it would be difficult to implement the second choice. The **third choice** is very plausible to do because when cards are drawn out to Janine, we can already calculate the probaiblity she has three of more suspect cards by calculating 1 - the probability she has at most two suspect cards in her hand. The **fourth choice** follows the same reasoning in the first choice. There is no way to simulate Janine's choice of going to the kitchen.
