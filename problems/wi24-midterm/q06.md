# BEGIN PROB

Which of the following probabilities could most easily be approximated
by writing a simulation in Python? Select the best answer.

( ) The probability that Janine wins the game.
( ) The probability that a three-player game takes less than 30 minutes to play.
( ) The probability that Janine has three or more suspect cards.
( ) The probability that Janine visits the kitchen at some point in the game.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The probability that Janine has three or more suspect cards.

Let's explain each choice and why it would be easy or difficult to simulate in Python. The **first choice** is difficult because these simulations depend on Janine's strategies and decisions in the game. There is no way to simulate people's choices. We can only simulate randomness. For the **second choice**, we are not given information on how long each part of the gameplay takes, so we would not be able to simulate the length of a game. The **third choice** is very plausible to do because when cards are dealt out to Janine, this is a random process which we can simulate in code, where we keep track of whether she has three of more suspect cards. The **fourth choice** follows the same reasoning as the first choice. There is no way to simulate Janine's moves in the game, as it depends on the decisions she makes while playing.
