Since Janine's knowledge of who holds each card will change throughout
the game, the `clue` DataFrame needs to be updated by setting particular
entries.

Suppose more generally that we want to write a function that changes the
value of an entry in a DataFrame. The function should work for any
DataFrame, not just `clue`.

What parameters would such a function require? Say what each parameter
represents.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** We would need four parameters:

-   `df`, the DataFrame to change.

-   `row`, the row label or row number of the entry to change.

-   `col`, the column label of the entry to change.

-   `val`, the value that we want to store at that location.
