Each of the following expressions evaluates to an integer.
Determine the value of that integer, if possible, or circle "not enough
information.\"

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py 
(clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine").sum() 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 6

This code counts the number of times that Janine appears in the `Cardholder` column. This is because `clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine"` will return a Series of `True` and `False` values of length 22 where `True` corresponds to a card belonging to Janine. Since 6 cards were dealt to her, the code will return 6.

```py
np.count_nonzero(clue.get("Category").str.contains("p")) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 13

This code counts the number of cells that contain that letter `"p"` in the `Category` column. `clue.get("Category").str.contains("p")` will return a Series that contains `True` if `"p"` is in that particular category cell and `False` otherwise. The word `"suspect"` and `"weapons"` both contain the letter `"p"` and since there are 6 and 7 of each respectively, the code will return 13.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py 
clue[(clue.get("Category") == "suspect") & (clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine")].shape[0] 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** not enough information

This code first filters only for rows that contain both `"suspect"` as the category and `"Janine"` as the cardholder and returns the number of rows of that DataFrame with `.shape[0]`. However, from the information given, we do not know how many `"suspect"` cards Janine has. 

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
len(clue.take(np.arange(5, 20, 3)).index) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 5

`np.arange(5, 20, 3)` will return a `np.array([5, 8, 11, 14, 17])`.`clue.take` will filter out the DataFrame to certain rows based on the `np.arange`. We will only filter rows with `index` of 5, 8, 11, 14, 17. Since we are running `.index` on that DataFrame and taking its length, we are finding the number of rows contained in the DataFrame. This returns 5 rows, which is the answer to this problem!

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
len(clue[clue.get("Category") >= "this"].index) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 7

Similarly to the previous problem, we are getting the number of rows of the DataFrame `clue` after filtering it. `clue.get("Category") >= "this"` returns a Boolean Series where True is returned when a string in `"Category"` is greater than alphabetically than `"this"`. This only happens when the string is `"weapon"`, which occurs 7 times. 

<average>29</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
clue.groupby("Cardholder").count().get("Category").sum() 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 22

`groupby("Cardholder").count()` will return a DataFrame indexed by `"Cardholder"` where each column contains the number of cards that each `"Cardholder"` has.  Then we sum the values in the `"Category"` column, which evaluates to 22  because the sum of the total number of cards each cardholder has is the total number of cards in play!
