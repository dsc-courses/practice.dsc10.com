# BEGIN PROB

Each of the following expressions evaluates to an integer.
Determine the value of that integer, if possible, or circle "not enough
information.\"

**Important**: Before proceeding, make sure to read the page called *Clue*: The Murder Mystery Game.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py 
(clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine").sum() 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 6
This code counts the number of times that Janine appears in the `Cardholder` column. This is because `clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine"` will return a series of True and False values of length 22 where True corresponds to a card belonging to Janine. Since 6 cards were dealt to her, the code will return 6!

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
np.count_nonzero(clue.get("Category").str.contains("p")) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 13
This code counts the number of cells that contain that letter 'p' in the `Category` column. `clue.get("Category").str.contains("p")` will return a series that contains True if 'p' is in that particular category cell and False otherwise. The word 'suspect' and 'weapons' both contain the letter 'p' and since there are 6 and 7 of each respectively, the code will return 13.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py 
clue[(clue.get("Category") == "suspect") & (clue.get("Cardholder") == "Janine")].shape[0] 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** not enough information
This code first filters only for rows that contain both 'suspect' as the category and 'Janine' as the cardholder and returns the number of rows of that dataframe with `.shape[0]`. However, from the information given, we do not know how many of cards are being held by Janine and 'suspect' cards. 

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
len(clue.take(np.arange(5, 20, 3)).index) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 5
`clue.take` will filter out the dataframe to certain rows based on the np.arange. Since we are running .index on that dataframe and taking its length, we are finding the number of rows contained in the dataframe after the `.take` method is called on the np.arange. `np.arange(5, 20, 3)` will return a `np.array([5, 8, 11, 14, 17])`. This returns 5 rows, which is the answer to this problem!

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
len(clue[clue.get("Category") >= "this"].index) 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 7
Similarly to the previous problem, we are getting the number of rows of the dataframe `clue` after filtering it. `clue.get("Category") >= "this"` returns a boolean Series where True is returned when a string in `"Category"` is greater than lexicographically than `"this"`. This only happens when the string is `"weapon"`, which occurs 7 times. 

<average>29</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

```py
clue.groupby("Cardholder").count().get("Category").sum() 
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 22
`groupby("Cardholder").count()` will return a dataframe indexed by cardholders and each column contains the number of cards that each cardholder has. Then we isolate the `"Category"` column by extracting it with the get method and then summing up the value. It will return 22 because the sum of the total number of cards each cardholder has is the total number of cards in play!
