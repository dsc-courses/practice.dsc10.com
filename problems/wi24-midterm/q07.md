Part of the gameplay of *Clue* involves moving around the gameboard. The
gameboard has 9 rooms, arranged on a grid, and players roll dice to
determine how many spaces they can move.

The DataFrame `dist` contains a row and a column for each of the 9
rooms. The entry in row $r$ and column $c$ represents the shortest
distance between rooms $r$ and $c$ on the *Clue* gameboard, or the
smallest dice roll that would be required to move between rooms $r$ and
$c$. Since you don't need to move at all to get from a room to the same
room, the entries on the diagonal are all 0.

`dist` is indexed by `"Room"`, and the room names appear exactly as they
appear in the index of the `clue` DataFrame. These same values are also
the column labels in `dist`.

Two of the following expressions are equivalent, meaning they evaluate
to the same value without erroring. Select these **two expressions**.

[ ] `dist.get("kitchen").loc["library"]`
[ ] `dist.get("kitchen").iloc["library"]`
[ ] `dist.get("library").loc["kitchen"]`
[ ] `dist.get("library").iloc["kitchen"]`

Explain in **one sentence** why these two expressions are the same.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `dist.get("kitchen").loc["library"]` and `dist.get("library").loc["kitchen"]`

On the *Clue* gameboard, there are two "secret passages.\" Each secret
passage connects two rooms. Players can immediately move through secret
passages without rolling, so in `dist` we record the distance as 0
between two rooms that are connected with a secret passage.

Suppose we run the following code.

```py
    nonzero = 0
    for col in dist.columns:
        nonzero = nonzero + np.count_nonzero(dist.get(col))
```

Determine the value of `nonzero` after the above code is run.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `nonzero` = 68

Fill in blanks so that the expression below evaluates to a DataFrame
with all the same information as `dist`, plus **one extra column**
called `"Cardholder"` containing Janine's knowledge of who holds each
room card.

```py
    dist.merge(___(a)___, ___(b)___, ___(c)___)
```

1.  What goes in blank (a)?

2.  What goes in blank (b)?

3.  What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- (a): `clue.get(["Cardholder"])`
- (b): `left_index=True`
- (c): `right_index=True`

<average>28</average>

Suppose we generate a scatter plot as follows.
```py
    dist.plot(kind="scatter", x="kitchen", y="study");
```
Suppose the scatterplot has a point at (4, 6). What can we conclude
about the *Clue* gameboard?

( ) The kitchen is 4 spaces away from the study.
( ) The kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.
( ) Another room besides the kitchen is 4 spaces away from the study.
( ) Another room besides the kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Another room besides the kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.
