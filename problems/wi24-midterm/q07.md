Part of the gameplay of *Clue* involves moving around the gameboard. The
gameboard has 9 rooms, arranged on a grid, and players roll dice to
determine how many spaces they can move.

The DataFrame `dist` contains a row and a column for each of the 9
rooms. The entry in row $r$ and column $c$ represents the shortest
distance between rooms $r$ and $c$ on the *Clue* gameboard, or the
smallest dice roll that would be required to move between rooms $r$ and
$c$. Since you don't need to move at all to get from a room to the same
room, the entries on the diagonal are all 0.

`dist` is indexed by `"Room"`, and the room names appear exactly as they
appear in the index of the `clue` DataFrame. These same values are also
the column labels in `dist`.

Two of the following expressions are equivalent, meaning they evaluate
to the same value without erroring. Select these **two expressions**.

[ ] `dist.get("kitchen").loc["library"]`
[ ] `dist.get("kitchen").iloc["library"]`
[ ] `dist.get("library").loc["kitchen"]`
[ ] `dist.get("library").iloc["kitchen"]`

Explain in **one sentence** why these two expressions are the same.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `dist.get("kitchen").loc["library"]` and `dist.get("library").loc["kitchen"]`
<br>
`dist.get("kitchen").iloc["library"]` and `dist.get("library").iloc["kitchen"]` are both wrong because it uses `iloc` inappropriately. `iloc[]` takes in an integer number representing the location of column, row, or cell you would like to extract and it does **not take a column or index name**. `dist.get("kitchen").loc["library"]` and `dist.get("library").loc["kitchen"]` lead to the same answer because the dataframe has a unique property! The entry at $r$, $c$ is the same as the entry at $c$, $r$ because both are the distances for the same two rooms.

On the *Clue* gameboard, there are two "secret passages.\" Each secret
passage connects two rooms. Players can immediately move through secret
passages without rolling, so in `dist` we record the distance as 0
between two rooms that are connected with a secret passage.

Suppose we run the following code.

```py
    nonzero = 0
    for col in dist.columns:
        nonzero = nonzero + np.count_nonzero(dist.get(col))
```

Determine the value of `nonzero` after the above code is run.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `nonzero` = 68
<br>
The `nonzero` variable represents the entries on the dataframe where the distance between two rooms is 0. There are 81 cells in the dataframe. Since the diagonal of the dataframe is 0 (due to the distance from a room to itself is 0), we know there are at most 72 nonzero cells in the dataframe. We also know there are 2 secret passages that connect 2 different rooms, which causes the distance to be 0. Each passage will cause 2 cells in the dataframe to have a distance of 0. For instance, if the passage was between kitchen and dining, then the cell at .`loc['kitchen', 'dining']` and `.loc['dining', 'kitchen']` would both be 0. This means there are 68 nonzero cells in the dataframe!

Fill in blanks so that the expression below evaluates to a DataFrame
with all the same information as `dist`, plus **one extra column**
called `"Cardholder"` containing Janine's knowledge of who holds each
room card.

```py
    dist.merge(___(a)___, ___(b)___, ___(c)___)
```

1.  What goes in blank (a)?

2.  What goes in blank (b)?

3.  What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- (a): `clue.get(["Cardholder"])`
- (b): `left_index=True`
- (c): `right_index=True`
<br>
Since we want to create a dataframe that looks like dist with an extra column of `"Cardholder"`, we want to extract that column from clue to merge with dist. We do this with `clue.get(["Cardholder"])`. Since the dataframe has the same info as dist, we want to keep the indices of the dist dataframe. Since dist is the left dataframe, we do `left_index=True` to keep the indices of the left dataframe. Since we also want the information from the clue dataframe, we do `right_index=True` to keep the indices of right dataframe.

Suppose we generate a scatter plot as follows.
```py
    dist.plot(kind="scatter", x="kitchen", y="study");
```
Suppose the scatterplot has a point at (4, 6). What can we conclude
about the *Clue* gameboard?

( ) The kitchen is 4 spaces away from the study.
( ) The kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.
( ) Another room besides the kitchen is 4 spaces away from the study.
( ) Another room besides the kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Another room besides the kitchen is 6 spaces away from the study.
<br>
Let's explain each choice and why they are wrong/right. The scatterplot shows how far a room from the kitchen (as shown by values on the x axis) and how far a room is from the study (as shown by the values on the y axis). Each room is represented by a point. The first choice and second choice are wrong because we do not know which point on the scatterplot is the kitchen. So we do not know how far the kitchen is from the study. The third choice is wrong because if we have a point at (4, 6), we have a room that is 4 spaces away from the kitchen and 6 spaces away from the study. This only leaves the last choice as the valid choice!
