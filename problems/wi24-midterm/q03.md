# BEGIN PROB

An important part of the game is knowing when you've narrowed it down to
just one suspect with one weapon in one room. Then you can make your
accusation and win the game!

Suppose the DataFrames `grouped` and `filtered` are defined as follows.
```py
    grouped = (clue.reset_index()
                   .groupby(["Category", "Cardholder"])
                   .count()
                   .reset_index())
    filtered = grouped[grouped.get("Cardholder") == "Unknown"]
```
# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank below so that `"Ready to accuse"` is printed when
Janine has enough information to make an accusation and win the game.

```py
    if filtered.get("Card").______ == 3:
        print("Ready to accuse")
```

What goes in the blank?

( ) `count()` 
( ) `sum()` 
( ) `max()` 
( ) `min()` 
( ) `shape[0]`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `sum()`

<average>50</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Now, let's look at a different way to do the same thing. Fill in the
blank below so that `"Ready to accuse"` is printed when Janine has
enough information to make an accusation and win the game.

```py
    if filtered.get("Card").______ == 1:
        print("Ready to accuse")
```

What goes in the blank?

( ) `count()` 
( ) `sum()` 
( ) `max()` 
( ) `min()` 
( ) `shape[0]`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `max()`

<average>40</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# END PROB
