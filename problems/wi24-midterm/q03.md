An important part of the game is knowing when you've narrowed it down to
just one suspect with one weapon in one room. Then you can make your
accusation and win the game!

Suppose the DataFrames `grouped` and `filtered` are defined as follows.
```py
    grouped = (clue.reset_index()
                   .groupby(["Category", "Cardholder"])
                   .count()
                   .reset_index())
    filtered = grouped[grouped.get("Cardholder") == "Unknown"]
```
# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank below so that `"Ready to accuse"` is printed when
Janine has enough information to make an accusation and win the game.

```py
    if filtered.get("Card").______ == 3:
        print("Ready to accuse")
```

What goes in the blank?

( ) `count()` 
( ) `sum()` 
( ) `max()` 
( ) `min()` 
( ) `shape[0]`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `sum()`

It is helpful to first visualize how both the `grouped` (left) and `filtered` (right) DataFrames could look:

<center>
<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 10px;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/wi24-midterm/grouped.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 50%;">
        <p style="max-width: 50%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;">`grouped` DataFrame contains the the number of cards for a certain `"Category"`/`"Cardholder"` combination</p>
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-left: 10px;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/wi24-midterm/filter.png" alt="Image 2" style="width: 50%;">
        <p style="max-width: 50%; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;">`filtered` DataFrame contains the the number of cards that are Unknown by `"room"`, `"suspect"` and `"weapon"`</p>
    </div>
</div>
</center>

Now, let's think about the scenario presented. We want a method that will return 3 from `filtered.get("Card").___`. We do not use `count()` because that is an aggregation function that appears after a `.groupby`, and there is no grouping here. 

According to the instructions, we want to know when we narrowed it down to **just one suspect with one weapon in one room**. This means for `filtered` DataFrame, each row should have 1 in the `"Card"` column when you are already to accuse. `sum()` works because when you have only 1 unknown card for each of the three categories, that means you have a sum of 3 unknown cards in total. You can make an accusation now!

Now, let's look at a different way to do the same thing. Fill in the
blank below so that `"Ready to accuse"` is printed when Janine has
enough information to make an accusation and win the game.

```py
    if filtered.get("Card").______ == 1:
        print("Ready to accuse")
```

What goes in the blank?

( ) `count()` 
( ) `sum()` 
( ) `max()` 
( ) `min()` 
( ) `shape[0]`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `max()`

This problem follows the same logic as the first except we only want to accuse when `filtered.get("Card").___ == 1`. As we saw in the previous part, we only want to accuse when all the numbers in the `"Card"` column are 1, as this represents one unknown in each category. This means the largest number in the `"Card"` column must be 1, so we can fill in the blank with `max()`.
