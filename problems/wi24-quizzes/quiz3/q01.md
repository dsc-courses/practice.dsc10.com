Suppose the function `first_two` takes as input a string and returns a
string with the first two characters only. For example
`first_two("panda")` is `"pa"`. Using this function, write an expression
that evaluates to a Series containing the **two-character airline
designator** for each flight in `flights`.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `flights.get("flight_num").apply(first_two)`

<average>78</average>
