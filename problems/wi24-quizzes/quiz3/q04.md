Fill in the blanks below so that `prob` evaluates to the probability
that a randomly selected flight from the `flights` DataFrame arrives at
`"SAN"` given that it departs from `"LAX"`.

    san = flights.get("arrival") == "SAN"
    lax = flights.get("departure") == "LAX"
    prob = flights[san___(x)___lax].shape[0] / ___(y)___


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (x):** `&`

<average>66</average>

**Answer (y):** `flights[lax].shape[0]`

<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write an expression that evaluates to the probability that a randomly
selected flight from the `flights` DataFrame is **not** on the airline
`"Delta"`.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**
`1 - flights[flights.get("airline") == "Delta"].shape[0] / flights.shape[0]` 
or
`flights[flights.get("airline") != "Delta"].shape[0] / flights.shape[0]` 
or 
`(flights.get("airline") != "Delta").mean()`
