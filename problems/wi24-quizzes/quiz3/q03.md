# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we have another DataFrame `more_flights` which contains the same
columns as `flights`, but different rows. Define `merged` as follows.
```py
        merged = flights.merge(more_flights, on = "airline")
```
Suppose that in `merged`, there are 108 flights where the airline is
`"United"`, and in `more_flights`, there are 12 flights where the
airline is `"United"`. If `flights` has 15 rows in total, how many of
these rows are **not** for `"United"` flights? Give your answer as an
integer.
