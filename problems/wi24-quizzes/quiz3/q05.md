Use the function defined below to answer the questions on the right.

    def discount(duration, price):
        if duration > 6:
            price = price * 0.9
        if duration > 4:
            price = price * 0.95 
        elif duration > 3:
            price = price * 0.98
        else:
            price = price * 0.99 
        price = price - 5 
        return price

What is the output of `discount(7, 100)`?

( ) `100 * 0.9 * 0.95 * 0.98 - 5`
( ) `100 * 0.9 * 0.95 - 5`
( ) `100 * 0.9 - 5`
( ) `100 * 0.9`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (x):** anything greater than `3` and less than or equal to `4`

<average>95</average>

**Answer (y):** `97`
<average>95</average>
