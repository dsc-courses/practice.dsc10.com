# BEGIN PROB

Suppose `fruits` is a DataFrame of the fruits Ashley bought at the
grocery store, where:

-   The `"fruit"` column contains the name of the fruit, as a string.
    All values in this column are distinct.

-   The `"price"` column contains the amount in dollars spent on the
    fruit, as a `float`.

-   The `"pounds"` column contains the number of **pounds** purchased,
    as an `int`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below to add a new column to `fruits` called
`"price_per_ounce"` that contains the price per ounce of each of the
fruits in `fruits`. **There are 16 ounces in a pound.**
```py
    fruits = fruits.__(x)__(price_per_ounce = __(y)__ / __(z)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (x):** `assign`

<average>71</average>

**Answer (y):** `fruits.get("price")`

<average>67</average>

**Answer (z):** `(fruits.get("pounds") * 16)`

<average>43</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write a line of code that evaluates to the amount of money, in dollars,
that Ashley spent on fruit at the grocery store.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `fruits.get("price").sum()` or `sum(fruits.get("price"))`

<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the name of
the fruit with the highest price per ounce.
```py
    (fruits.sort_values(by = "price_per_ounce", ascending = __(x)__)
           .get(__(y)__).iloc[0])
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (x):** `False`

<average>87</average>

**Answer (y):** `"fruit"`

<average>65</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Assuming that `"mango"` is one of the fruits Ashley bought, fill in the
blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the price per ounce of
`"mango"`.
```py
    fruits.__(x)__("fruit").get("price_per_ounce").__(y)__["mango"]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (x):** `set_index`

<average>41</average>

**Answer (y):** `loc`

<average>83</average>
