UCSD's parking lots include A spaces for faculty, B spaces for staff,
and S spaces for students.

The scatter plot on the left shows the relationship between the number
of A spaces and the total number of parking spaces in each region of
campus. Similarly, the scatter plot on the right shows the relationship
between the number of B spaces and the total number of parking spaces in
each region of campus. Note that these numbers represent a **count of
parking spaces existing** on campus, and have nothing to do with
occupancy.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Based on these scatter plots, which pair of variables has a larger
correlation coefficient?

( ) A Spaces and Total Spaces 
( ) B Spaces and Total Spaces

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** B Spaces and Total Spaces
<average>86</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following variables would most likely be negatively
associated with the total number of spaces in a campus region?

( ) Total area of the campus region
( ) Number of athletic fields in the campus region
( ) Number of residents in the campus region
( ) Number of electric vehicle charging stations in the campus region

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Number of athletic fields in the campus region
<average>73</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

The number of S spaces and the total number of parking spaces in each
campus region are linearly related with a correlation coefficient of
0.6. The number of S spaces in the Warren College region of campus is 5
standard deviations below average. What does the regression line predict
for the number of total spaces in Warren College, measured in standard
units?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** -3
<average>64</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: Since number of parking spaces is always a positive
integer, the regression line that predicts the total number of spaces
from the number of S spaces must have a positive $y$-intercept.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False
<average>64</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
