Suppose the Series `s` is defined as below. Write an expression
involving `s` that evaluates to the observed value of the test
statistic, and store the result in `observed`.

        s = parking.groupby("Structure").mean().get("Occupancy")
        observed = ______

What goes in the blank?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `s.loc["Hopkins"] - s.loc["Gilman"]`

In running the permutation test, we need to do a simulation that runs
many times, using a `for`-loop. What should be the first thing we do
inside the `for`-loop?

( ) Initialize an empty array to store our results.
( ) Define a variable for the number of repetitions.
( ) Permute one of the columns of `parking`.
( ) Calculate the difference in group means.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Permute one of the columns of `parking`.

Suppose we store 5000 simulated test statistics in the array
`differences`. Choose the appropriate symbol to fill in the calculation
of the p-value below.

    p_value = np.count_nonzero(differences ______ observed) / 5000

( ) `<` 
( ) `<=` 
( ) `==` 
( ) `!=` 
( ) `>` 
( ) `>=`
