Bill claims that San Diego is sunny 60% of the year, but you think the
percentage is higher. You decide to test the validity of Bill's claim by
running a hypothesis test.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Both your null and alternative hypotheses will take this form:

*The percentage of sunny days in San Diego is ______ 60%.*

\(i\) For the null hypothesis, how should we fill in the blank?

( ) equal to 
( ) not equal to 
( ) greater than 
( ) less than

\(ii\) For the alternative hypothesis, how should we fill in the blank?

( ) equal to 
( ) not equal to 
( ) greater than 
( ) less than

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (i):** equal to
<average>89</average>

**Answer (ii):** greater than
<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

Say that in 2023, San Diego had 235 sunny days. Using the number of
sunny days per year as the test statistic, fill in the following code to
run the hypothesis test and store the p-value of your test in `p_val`.
We'll assume that all years have 365 days.

```py
    observed_stat = ___(w)___
    results = np.array([])

    for i in np.arange(10000):
        result = np.___(x)___(365, ___(y)___)[0] 
        results = np.append(results, result)

    p_val = np.count_nonzero(results __(z)__ observed_stat) / 10000
```


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (w):** `235`

<average>58</average>

**Answer (x):** `random.multinomial`

<average>93</average>

**Answer (y):** `[0.6, 0.4]`

<average>65</average>

**Answer (z):** `>=`

<average>67</average>

Suppose the p-value of this hypothesis test is 0.1. Which of the following statements is a correct interpretation of this p-value?

( ) If the null hypothesis is true, there is a 10% chance of obtaining a test statistic equal to the observed statistic.
( ) If the null hypothesis is true, there is a 90% chance of obtaining a test statistic equal to the observed statistic.
( ) If the null hypothesis is true, there is a 10% chance of obtaining a test statistic equal to, or at least as extreme as, the observed statistic.
( ) If the alternative hypothesis is true, there is a 90% chance of obtaining a test statistic equal to, or at least as extreme as, the observed statistic.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** If the null hypothesis is true, there is a 10% chance of obtaining a test statistic equal
to, or at least as extreme as, the observed statistic.

<average>76</average>
