Suppose you want to estimate the proportion of UCSD students that prefer
sunny days over rainy days. You plan to survey 900 students, then
construct a 95% confidence interval for this proportion. What is the
**widest possible width** for the resulting confidence interval? Give
your answer as a **fully simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{15}$
<average>38</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If you decide to survey 450 students instead of 900 students for your
sample, the maximum possible width of your 95% confidence interval
would:

( ) double
( ) increase by more than double
( ) increase by less than double

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** increase by less than double

<average>60</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
