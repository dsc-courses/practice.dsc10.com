Charlie spends 100 days in each of three California cities (San Diego,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles). He records the primary weather for each
day in each location. The table below shows these values as proportions.
For example, 43 of the 100 days that Charlie spent in San Diego had
primarily sunny weather.

Charlie reconsiders his weather categories and decides to count any
"partly cloudy" days as "cloudy" days, thereby combining these two
categories into one. If he recalculates the TVD between any pair of
cities, what will he find?

( ) The new TVD is less than or equal to the old TVD.
( ) The new TVD is greater than or equal to the old TVD.
( ) The new TVD is equal to the old TVD.
( ) There is not enough information to determine the relationship
between the new\
TVD and the old TVD.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The new TVD is less than or equal to the old TVD.
