In response to the pandemic, some airlines chose to leave middle seats empty, while others continued seating passengers in middle seats. Let's suppose Delta did not seat passengers in middle seats during the pandemic, and United did seat passengers in middle seats during the pandemic.

Delta wants to know whether customers were satisfied with them for making this decision not to use middle seats. Suppose they have access to a dataset of customer satisfaction surveys, taken annually for each airline. How can Delta determine whether its new seating policy caused an increase in customer satisfaction?

( ) Compare Delta's average customer satisfaction before and after this change went into effect.
( ) Compare Delta's average customer satisfaction after the change went into effect to United's average customer satisfaction at the same point in time.
( ) Compare the change in Delta's average customer satisfaction to the change in United's average customer satisfaction, throughout the same period of time, spanning the change.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** None of the above.

None of the options isolate the effect of the seating policy because they do not use randomized controlled trials. Even measuring the change in each airline's average satisfaction rating as described in the third option is insufficient because we don't know whether any differences are due to the changed seating policy or other changes. It's possible that many things changed around the time of the pandemic, and we have no way of separating the effects of each of these changes. For example, maybe United stopped serving snacks during the pandemic and Delta continued serving snacks, at around the same time as the seating changes went into effect. If we find a difference in average customer satisfaction between the airlines, we have no way of knowing whether it's because of the differences in seating policies or snack policies (or something else).
