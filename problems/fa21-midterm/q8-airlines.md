It turns out that King Triton is so busy that he doesn't even book his own flights â€“ he has a travel agent who books his flights for him. He doesn't get to choose the airline that he flies on, but his travel agent gave him the following table, which describes the probability of each of his flights in 2022 being on Delta, United, American, or another airline:

| Airline | Chance |
| --- | --- |
| Delta | 0.4 |
| United | 0.3 |
| American | 0.2 |
| All other airlines | 0.1 |

The airline for one flight has no impact on the airline for another flight.

For this question, suppose that King Triton schedules 3 flights for January 2022.
