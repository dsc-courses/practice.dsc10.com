One of your classes this quarter, PTS 1: _Principles of Taylor Swift_, has the following grading scheme:

- 20% Midterm 1
- 20% Midterm 2
- 30% Homeworks (lowest homework dropped)
- 30% Final Exam

There are 4 homework assignments, but your lowest homework score is dropped from your overall grade calculation. Each homework assignment is worth the same amount in your overall grade calculation, even though they have different numbers of available points. Your scores on all parts of the course, before the final exam, are as follows:

- Midterm 1: $\frac{98}{100}$
- Midterm 2: $\frac{16}{38}$
- Homework 1: $\frac{3}{4}$
- Homework 2: $\frac{18}{25}$
- Homework 3: $\frac{9}{10}$
- Homework 4: $\frac{12}{13}$

What is the minimum possible score you can earn on the Final Exam, **as a percentage**, to guarantee that you finish with at least an 80% overall in PTS 1? You may use a calculator.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

Let $f$ be your Final Exam score in PTS 1, as a decimal between 0 and 1. (We'll treat $f$ as a decimal because all of your other scores are provided to us as decimals, or fractions, as well.) If we knew $f$, we could calculate your overall grade right now:

$$20\% \cdot \text{Midterm 1 Score} + 20\% \cdot \text{Midterm 2 Score} + 30\% \cdot \text{Average Homework Score, with Lowest Dropped} + 30\% \cdot f$$

We don't know $f$, but we do know the other variables in the above expression. Your Midterm Exam scores are given to us directly, but your average homework score, after dropping your lowest homework, requires a bit of calculation to find. First, we need to find which of the four homeworks you did the worst on, so that we can exclude it when calculating your average homework score. That happens to be Homework 2, which you scored a 72% on; we can find this without a calculator by noticing that $25 \cdot 4 = 100$, so $\frac{18}{25} = \frac{18 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{72}{100} = 72\%$. This is lower than Homework 1, which you scored a $\frac{3}{4} = 75\%$ on; Homework 3, which you scored a $\frac{9}{10} = 90\%$ on, and Homework 4
