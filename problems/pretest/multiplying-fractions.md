# BEGIN PROB

Express $\frac{42}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21}$ as an integer without using a calculator and without long division or multiplication.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 8

The idea is to look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and then cancel. We notice that 42 and 21 both share a factor of 7, and that 36 is a multiple of 9.

$$\begin{align*}\frac{42}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} &= \frac{6 \cdot 7}{9} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 7} \\ &= \frac{6 \cdot \sout{7}}{\sout{9}} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot \sout{9}}{3 \cdot \sout{7}} \\ &= \frac{6}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \\ &= \frac{2 \cdot \sout{3}}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{\sout{3}} \\ &= 2 \cdot 4 \\ &= 8 \end{align*}$$

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB

<!-- Then we can cancel a 7 and two 3s to get $2\cdot2\cdot2 = 8$. 

We can also do this one bit at a time by noticing common factors in the numerator and denominator. For example, we might simplify this as
$$\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} = \frac{42}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{21} = \frac{6}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 8.$$ -->
