Express $\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21}$ as an integer without using a calculator and without long division or multiplication.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

The idea is to look for common factors in the numerator and denominator and then cancel. Letâ€™s factor all of the terms as much as possible to make this process easier:

$$\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} = \frac{14 \cdot 36}{9 \cdot 21} = \frac{7\cdot2\cdot3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2}{3\cdot3\cdot7\cdot3}$$

Then we can cancel a 7 and three 3s to get $2\cdot2\cdot2 = 8$. 

We can also do this one bit at a time by noticing common factors in the numerator and denominator. For example, we might simplify this as
$$\frac{14}{9} \cdot \frac{36}{21} = \frac{42}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{21} = \frac{6}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = 8.$$
