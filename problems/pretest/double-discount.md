A bicycle shop is going out of business and has a 30% discount on all bikes. I also have a coupon for an additional 40% off any bike. As compared to the original price, what discount will I get if I use my coupon on top of the going-out-of-business discount? Solve this problem without a calculator.

**Answer**: 58%

The going-out-of-business discount is a 30% discount, which means I will pay 70% of the original cost of a bicycle. If I use my coupon to get 40% off, this means I will pay only 60% of that already-discounted amount. 60% of 70% is 42% of the original cost, which we obtain by multiplying 0.6 $\cdot$ 0.7 = 0.42. This corresponds to a 58% discount off the original price. So I can get the mattress for less than half its original price when combining both discounts!

Notice that 40% off on top of 30% off does not equal 70% off. Percentages donâ€™t add in this way, they multiply. An easy way to see this is if you took 50% off on top of 50% off. That would be half price of half price, which is a quarter of the original price. Your discount would be 75%, not 50% + 50% = 100%. That would be too good to be true!
