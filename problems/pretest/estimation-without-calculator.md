# BEGIN PROB

Choose the answer below that is closest to $412 \cdot 289$, without using a calculator and without performing long multiplication.

( ) $40{,}000$
( ) $80{,}000$
( ) $120{,}000$
( ) $160{,}000$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $120{,}000$

We can estimate the answer by solving a similar problem, $400\cdot300$, which has numbers close to those given, but are much easier to work with. Since $400\cdot300 = 120{,}000$, we would estimate that $412\cdot289$ is similar. If youâ€™re curious, a calculator will tell you that $412\cdot289 = 122{,}776$.
