There are six different colors of M&M candies: yellow, blue, green, red, orange, and brown.  You and your friend are playing a game. You will pick five M&Ms from a bag with your eyes closed. Your friend will give you a prize if none of the candies you picked are yellow, green, or blue. Unfortunately, when you play this game, you don't win the prize. What does this say about the candies you chose? For each statement below, say whether the statement **must be true**, **may be true**, or **cannot be true**.

1. All five M&M's were the same color, either yellow, blue, or green.
1. All five M&M's were the same color, either red, orange, or brown.
1. All five M&M's were one of the following colors: yellow, blue, green.
1. All five M&M's were one of the following colors: red, orange, brown.
1. One or more M&M's was yellow, blue, or green.
1. One or more M&M's was red, orange, or brown.
1. None of the M&M's were yellow, blue, or green.
1. None of the M&M's were red, orange, or brown.

To win the prize, you must select five M&Ms and end up with no yellow, no green, and no blue M&Ms. Since you didn't win the prize, among your five selected M&Ms, there must be at least one M&M that is yellow, blue, or green. That's all we know for sure about the five M&Ms we selected.

1\. All five M&M's were the same color, either yellow, blue, or green. **May be true.**

You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below, because both of them would fail to win you the prize. It's possible that all five candies were green (or yellow, or blue) but it's not necessarily the case.

2\. All five M&M's were the same color, either red, orange, or brown. **Cannot be true.**

If this were true, the condition for winning the prize would be satisfied: none of the candies you picked would be yellow, green, or blue. So this cannot be true.

---

3\. All five M&M's were one of the following colors: yellow, blue, green. **May be true.**

You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below, because both of them would fail to win you the prize. All we know is that at least one of the candies has to be yellow, blue, or green. They might all be those colors, or they might not.

4\. All five M&M's were one of the following colors: red, orange, brown. **Cannot be true.**

If all five candies were red, orange, or brown, such as in the picture below, you would have actually won the prize. Since you didn't win the prize, that tells us this can't be true.

---

5\. One or more M&M's was yellow, blue, or green. **Must be true.**

This has to be true, because if it were not true, you would have won the prize. The opposite of "one or more" is "none" and the condition to win the prize was that none of your candies could be yellow, blue, or green.

---

6\. One or more M&M's was red, orange, or brown. **May be true.**

It could be the case that you had a red, orange, or brown candy among your five, as in the first picture below. But you may have also not had any red, orange, or browns, like in the second picture below. For both groups of candies shown below, you would have failed to win the prize.

---

7\. None of the M&M's were yellow, blue, or green. **Cannot be true.**

This is exactly the winning condition, but we know you did not win the prize, so this cannot be true.

---

8\. None of the M&M's were red, orange, or brown. **May be true.**

You failed to win the prize because you had at least one candy that was yellow, blue, or green. You may have had some red, orange, or brown candies included among your five, or you may not have. Either of the two groups of five below is possible, because you would not have won the prize either way.
