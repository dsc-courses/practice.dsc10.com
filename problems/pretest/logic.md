There are six different colors of M&M candies: yellow, blue, green, red, orange, and brown.  You and your friend are playing a game. You will pick five M&Ms from a bag with your eyes closed. Your friend will give you a prize if none of the candies you picked are yellow, green, or blue. Unfortunately, when you play this game, you don't win the prize. What does this say about the candies you chose? For each statement below, say whether the statement **must be true**, **may be true**, or **cannot be true**.

1. All five M&M's were the same color, either yellow, blue, or green.

To win the prize, you must select five M&Ms and end up with no yellow, no green, and no blue M&Ms. Since you didn't win the prize, among your five selected M&Ms, there must be at least one M&M that is yellow, blue, or green. That's all we know for sure about the five M&Ms we selected. Now, let's take a look at the options.

1. All five M&M's were the same color, either yellow, blue, or green. **May be true.**

You could have gotten either of the groups of candies shown below, because both of them would fail to win you the prize. It's possible that all five candies were green (or yellow, or blue) but it's not necessarily the case.
