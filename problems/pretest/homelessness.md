Every year, San Diego's Regional Task Force on Homelessness conducts a "point-in-time" count of the number of homeless individuals in San Diego County. They send out a team of over a thousand volunteers to locate and count homeless individuals throughout the county's shelters, streets, encampments, cars, etc. In 2023, newspapers reported that the count increased by 22% from the 2022 count. Part of that increase was explained by the fact that for the first time, volunteers were able to access and count people on Caltrans property. It was also reported that if we were to exclude the people who were counted on Caltrans property, the count would have still increased by 14%, meaning that the additional area covered could not explain all of the increase from one year's count to the next. The 2023 point-in-time count was 10,264 individuals.

The point-in-time count is an underestimate of the true number of homeless individuals in San Diego County. Why is it always an underestimate?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Volunteers may miss some people who should have been counted, since it can be hard to locate every single homeless person.

How many individuals in 2023 were counted on Caltrans property? You may use a calculator.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 673

We are told that 10,264 homeless individuals were counted in 2023 and that this was a 22% increase from the 2022 count. We can use this information to find the 2022 count, which we will call $x$. Since $1.22x = 10{,}264$, we can divide both sides by 1.22 to find that the 2022 count was 8413. The 2023 count of people excluding those counted on Caltrans property is 14% higher than this number, which is $1.14 \cdot 8413 = 9591$. The difference between the total 2023 count and the count excluding those on Caltrans property is therefore $10{,}264 - 9591 = 673$. 

Here is another way to solve this problem without actually calculating the 2022 count. Again, let $x$ represent the 2022 count. We want to find the difference between the full 2023 count, which is $1.22x$, and the 2023 count without those counted on Caltrans property, which is $1.14x$. Therefore, we need to find $1.22x - 1.14x = 0.08x$. We know $1.22x = 10{,}264$ as before. So, $x = \frac{10{,}264}{1.22}$ and $0.08x = 0.08 \cdot \frac{10{,}264}{1.22} = 673$.

The actual number of individuals counted on Caltrans property in 2023 was 661, which should be close to your answer to the previous question, but not exactly the same. Did the newspapers make a mistake or is there another explanation for the discrepancy?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The discrepancy is most likely due to rounding. Notice that when the newspaper reported the percent increases (22 and 14), it gave them as whole numbers even though the actual percent increases could not have been whole numbers. 

If $x$ represents the 2022 count, then based on the informtion given in the question, we have $1.22x = 10{,}264$. The exact solution to this equation is actually $x = 8413.1147541$, but since $x$ represents a count of people, it must be a whole number. This means the 1.22 number in this equation is an approximation, because it's easier (both to report and to interpret) a percent increase that is a whole number and not a decimal.
