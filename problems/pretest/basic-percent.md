Express $\frac{16}{40}$ as a percentage without using a calculator and without long division or multiplication.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 40%

There are many ways to do this. One way is to simplify the fraction. The numerator, 16, and the denominator, 40, are both divisible by 4, so the fraction is equivalent to $\frac{4}{10}$, which is same as $\frac{40}{100}$, or 40%. 

Another way is to solve the equation $\frac{16}{40} = \frac{x}{100}$. We can solve this equation for $x$ by multiplying both sides by 100, to get $x = \frac{1600}{40}$. Since both the numerator and denominator end in 0, we can divide both by 10, to get $x = \frac{160}{4}$, or $x = 40$. 

We can also solve this by recognizing that $40 \cdot 2.5 = 100$. Therefore if we also multiply the numerator of 16 by 2.5, we will convert $\frac{16}{40}$ to its corresponding fraction out of 100, which is $\frac{16 \cdot 2.5}{40 \cdot 2.5} = \frac{40}{100}$, or 40%.
