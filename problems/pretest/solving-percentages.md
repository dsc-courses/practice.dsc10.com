# BEGIN PROB

I just paid my friend $50 on Venmo and that used up 25% of my Venmo account balance. How much money do I have left in my Venmo account afterwards?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

If \$50 was 25\%, or one fourth, of my account balance, then my original account balance was $\$50 \cdot 4 = \$200$. After I pay the $50 to my friend, my account balance drops to $\$200 - \$50 = \$150.$
