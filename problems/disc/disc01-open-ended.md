Propose a scenario where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be **unethical**.

# BEGIN SOLN

**Possible answer:** Conducting an experiment where researchers want to study if smoking in mothers during pregnancy negatively affects brain development in their children. 

Although theoretically possible with an RCT to prove causation, an RCT would be highly unethical and should not be conducted because randomly assigning mothers to a smoking group would be detrimental for the mother and her child. An observational study would be more ethical in this scenario.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Propose a scenario where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be **impractical** (impossible to run, but not for ethical reasons).

# BEGIN SOLN

**Possible answer:** Conducting an experiment to determine if taking AP classes in high school cause better performance on the SAT among high schoolers. 

This would be impractical since it would not be possible to control for extraneous factors. A major confounding variable would be the students' preparation and studying outside of class, since this extra preparation they take would be independent of their classes while having an impact on their SAT score. It would also be impossible to control for the test-taking environment for the SAT since students take it in different locations and even on different days.
