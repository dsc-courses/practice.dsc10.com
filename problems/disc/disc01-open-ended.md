Propose a scenario where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be **unethical**.

# BEGIN SOLN

**Possible answer:** Conducting an experiment where researchers want to study if smoking in mothers during pregnancy negatively affects brain development in their children. 

Although theoretically possible with an RCT to prove causation, an RCT would be highly unethical and should not be conducted because randomly assigning mothers to a smoking group would be detrimental for the mother and her child. An observational study would be more ethical in this scenario.

Propose a scenario where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be **impractical** (impossible to run, but not for ethical reasons).

# BEGIN SOLN

**Possible answer:** Conducting an experiment to determine if winning the lottery increases happiness in middle-aged adults. 

It is not possible to provide the treatment (winning the lottery) as this is something that happens by chance, and is not something we can control. When we cannot control how participants receive a treatment, a RCT becomes impractical.
