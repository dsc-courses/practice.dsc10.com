# BEGIN PROB

**True or False**: The slope of the regression line, when both variables are measured in original units, is never more than 1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** False

Original units refers to units as they are. Clearly, regression slopes can be greater than 1 (for example if for every change
in 1 unit of x corresponds to a change in 20 units of y the slope will be 20). 

<average>96</average>
