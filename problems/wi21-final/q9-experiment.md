Suppose you do an experiment in which you do some random process 500 times and calculate the value of some statistic, which is a count of how many times a certain phenomenon occurred out of the 500 trials. You repeat the experiment 10,000 times and draw a histogram of the 10,000 statistics.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Is this histogram a probability histogram or an empirical histogram?

( ) probability histogram
( ) empirical histogram

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** empirical histogram

Empirical histograms refer to distributions of observed data. Since the question at hand is conducting
an experiment and creating a histogram of observed data from these trials the correct anwser is an empirical histogram.

If you instead repeat the experiment 100,000 times, how will the histogram change?

( ) it will become wider
( ) it will become narrower
( ) it will barely change at all
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** it will barely change at all

Doing more of an experiment will barely change the histogram. The parameter we are trying
to estimate through our experiment is some statistic. The number of experiments has no effect
on the histograms distribution since the value of some statistic is not becoming more random.

For each experiment, if you instead do the random process 5,000 times, how will the histogram change?

( ) it will become wider
( ) it will become narrower
( ) it will barely change at all

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** it will become wider

By increasing the number of random process we increase the possible range of values from 500 to 5000. The
statistic being calculated is the count of how many times a phenomenon occurs. If the number of random process increases 10x
the statistic can now take values ranging from `[0, 5000]` instead of `[0, 500]` which will clearly 
make the histogram width wider (due to the wider range of values it can take). 

<average>39</average>
