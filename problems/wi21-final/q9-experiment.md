# BEGIN PROBLEM

Suppose you do an experiment in which you do some random process 500 times and calculate the value of some statistic, which is a count of how many times a certain phenomenon occurred out of the 500 trials. You repeat the experiment 10,000 times and draw a histogram of the 10,000 statistics.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Is this histogram a probability histogram or an empirical histogram?

( ) probability histogram
( ) empirical histogram

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** empirical histogram

Some explanation

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If you instead repeat the experiment 100,000 times, how will the histogram change?

( ) it will become wider
( ) it will become narrower
( ) it will barely change at all
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** it will barely change at all

Some explanation

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

For each experiment, if you instead do the random process 5,000 times, how will the histogram change?
( ) it will become wider
( ) it will become narrower
( ) it will barely change at all

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** it will become wider
