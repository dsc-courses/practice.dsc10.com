# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** hypothesis testing

The question at hand is dealing with differences between sales of different flavors
of ice cream. We can use hypothesis testing to test our null hypothesis that Vanilla's sales are higher than Choclate
and the alternative as Chocolate has more sales than Vanilla. A permutation test is not suitable here as
we are not interested if Chocolate and Vanilla sales are drawn from the same underlying distribution, but rather are interested
an underlying model (in this case which is about the sales of different flavors of ice cream).
