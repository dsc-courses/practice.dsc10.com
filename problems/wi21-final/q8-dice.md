# BEGIN PROBLEM

**True or False**: If you roll two dice, the probability of rolling two fives is the same as the probability of rolling a six and a three.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** False

The probability of rolling two fives can be found with 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. The probability of 
rolling a six and a three can be found with 2/6 (can roll either a 3 or 6) * 1/6 (roll the same as the first dice) = 1/18.
Therefore, the probabilities are not the same.
