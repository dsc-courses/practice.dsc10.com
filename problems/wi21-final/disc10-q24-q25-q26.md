( ) Central Limit Theorem
( ) regression

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** permutation (A/B) testing

The question *Are nonfiction books longer than fiction books?* is investigating 
the difference between two underlying populations (nonfiction books and fiction books).
A permutation test is the best data science tool when investigating differences between two
underlying distributions.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** regression

The question at hand is investigating two continuous variables (time and number of friends). 
Regression is the best data science tool as it is dealing with two continuous variables and we can understand
correlations between time and the number of friends.

*Does an ice cream shop sell more chocolate or vanilla ice cream cones?*

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** hypothesis testing

The question at hand is dealing with differences between sales of different flavors of ice cream. We can use hypothesis testing to test our null hypothesis that Vanilla's sales are higher than Chocolate and the alternative as Chocolate has more sales than Vanilla. A permutation test is not suitable here because we are not comparing any numerical quantity associated with each group ("sales" is more of a general concept rather than a numerical quantity). A permutation test could be used to answer questions like "Are chocolate ice cream cones more expensive than vanilla ice cream cones?" or "Do chocolate ice cream cones have more calories than vanilla ice cream cones?", or any other question where you are tracking a number along with each ice cream cone.
