# BEGIN PROBLEM

You sample from a population by assigning each element of the population a number starting with 1. You include element 1 in your sample. Then you generate a random number, nn, between 2 and 5, inclusive, and you take every nth element after element 1 to be in your sample. For example, if you select n=2, then your sample will be elements 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

**True or False**: Before the sample is drawn, you can calculate the probability of selecting each subset of the population.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True
