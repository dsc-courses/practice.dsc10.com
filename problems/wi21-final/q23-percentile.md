# BEGIN PROBLEM

Recall the mathematical definition of percentile and how we calculate it.

| Let *p* be a number between 0 and 100. The *p*th percentile of a collection is the smallest 
| value in the collection that is at least as large as *p*% of all the values. 

By this definition, any percentile between 0 and 100 can be computed for any collection of values and is always an element of the collection. Suppose there are *n* elements in the collection. To find the 
*p*th percentile:

1. Sort the collection in increasing order.
2. Find *p*% of *n*: (*p*/100) *n*. Call that *h*. If *h* is an integer, define *k*=*h*. Otherwise, let *k* be the smallest integer greater than *h*.
3. Take the *k*th element of the sorted collection.
