# BEGIN PROB

**True or False**: Suppose that from a sample, you compute a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval for a population parameter to be the interval [L, R]. Then the average of L and R is the mean of the original sample.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** False

False, a 95% confidence interval indicates we  are 95% confident that the true population
parameter falls within the interval [L, R]. Note that the problem specifies that the confidence
interval is bootstrapped. Since the interval is found using bootstrapping, L anr R averaged will not be
the mean of the original sample since the mean of the original sample is not what is used in calculating
the bootstrapped confidence interval. The bootstrapped confidence interval (as noted on the reference sheet
is created by re-sampling the data with replacement over and over again). Thus, the interval is not centered around the mean because bootstrapping and random sampling will lead to variation in the confidence interval.
