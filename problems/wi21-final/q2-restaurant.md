The command .set_index can take as input one column, to be used as the index, or a sequence of columns to be used as a nested index (sometimes called a MultiIndex). A MultiIndex is the default behavior of the table returned by .groupby with multiple columns.

You are given a table called restaurants that contains information on a variety of local restaurants' daily number of customers and daily income. There is a row for each restaurant for each date in a given five-year time period.

The columns of restaurants are name (string), year (int),  month (int), day (int), num_diners (int), and income (float).

Assume that in our data set, there are not two different restaurants that go by the same name (chain restaurants, for example).

Which of the following would be the best way to set the index for this dataset?
