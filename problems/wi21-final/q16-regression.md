# BEGIN PROBLEM

**True or False**:The slope of the regression line, when both variables are measured in standard units, is never more than 1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

Standard units standardize the data into z scores. When converting to Z scores the scale of both
the dependent and independent variables are the same, and consequently, the slope can at most increase by 1.
