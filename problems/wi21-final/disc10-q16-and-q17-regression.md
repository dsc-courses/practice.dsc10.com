**True or False**: The slope of the regression line, when both variables are measured in standard units, is never more than 1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

Standard units standardize the data into z scores. When converting to Z scores the scale of both
the dependent and independent variables are the same, and consequently, the slope can at most increase by 1. Alternatively, according to the reference sheet, the slope of the regression line, when both variables are measured in standard units, is also equal to the correlation coefficient. And by definition, the correlation coefficient can never be greater than 1 (since you can't have more than a 'perfect' correlation).

**True or False**: The slope of the regression line, when both variables are measured in original units, is never more than 1.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** False

Original units refers to units as they are. Clearly, regression slopes can be greater than 1 (for example if for every change
in 1 unit of x corresponds to a change in 20 units of y the slope will be 20).
