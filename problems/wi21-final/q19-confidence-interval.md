# BEGIN PROB

**True or False**: Suppose that from a sample, you compute a 95% normal confidence interval for a population parameter to be the interval [L, R]. Then the average of L and R is the mean of the original sample.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

True, a 95% confidence interval indicates we are 95% confident that the true population
parameter falls within the interval [L, R]. Looking at how a confidence interval is calculated is by adding/
subtracting a confidence level value (z) by the standard error. Since the top and bottom of the interval
will be different from the mean by the same amount, the average will be the mean. (For more information, refer to the reference sheet)
