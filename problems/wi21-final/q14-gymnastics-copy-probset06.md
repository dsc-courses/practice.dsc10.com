The data visualization below shows all Olympic gold medals for womenâ€™s gymnastics, broken down by the age of the gymnast.

Based on this data, rank the following three quantities in **ascending** order: the median age at which gold medals are earned, the mean age at which gold medals are earned, the standard deviation of the age at which gold medals are earned.

( ) mean, median, SD
( ) median, mean, SD
( ) SD, mean, median
( ) SD, median, mean

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** SD, median, mean

The standard deviation will clearly be the smallest of the three values as most of the data is encompassed
between the range of `[14-26]`. Intuitively, the standard deviation will have to be about a third of this range
which is around 4 (though this is not the exact standard deviation, but is clearly much less than the mean
and median with values closer to 19-25). Comparing the median and mean, it is important to visualize that this 
distribution is skewed right. When the data is skewed right it pulls the mean towards a higher value (as the higher values
naturally make the average higher). Therefore, we know that the mean will be greater than the median and the ranking is 
SD, median, mean. 
<average>72</average>
