# BEGIN PROBLEM

From a population with mean 500 and standard deviation 50, you collect a sample of size 100. The sample has mean 400 and standard deviation 40. You bootstrap this sample 10,000 times, collecting 10,000 resample means.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following is the most accurate description of the mean of the distribution of the 10,000 bootstrapped means?

( ) The mean will be exactly equal to 400.
( ) The mean will be exactly equal to 500.
( ) The mean will be approximately equal to 400.
( ) The mean will be approximately equal to 500.
# BEGIN SOLUTION
