# BEGIN PROB

If we merge a table with `n` rows with a table with `m` rows, how many rows does the resulting table have?

( ) `n`
( ) `m`
( ) `max(m,n)`
( ) `m * n`
( ) not enough information to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** not enough information to tell

The question does not provide enough information to know the resulting table size with certainty. When
merging two tables together, the tables can be merged with a inner, left, right, and outer join. Each of these
joins will produce a different amount of rows. Since the question does not provide the type of join, it is impossible to tell
the resulting table size. 

<average>74</average>
