# BEGIN PROB

Give an example of a dataset and a question you would want to answer about that dataset which you could answer by performing a permutation test (also known as an A/B test). 

Creative responses that are different than ones we've already seen in this class will earn the most credit.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Responses vary. For this question we looked for creative responses. One good example includes

A dataset about prisoners in the US with the sentence times, race, and crime. Do White people who commit homicide get shorter sentence times than Black people who commit homicide?
We can clearly perform an A/B test to compare black and white populations as they correlated to shorter sentence times.

<average>93</average>
