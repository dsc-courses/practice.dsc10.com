Consider the following four slopes.

1. The slope of the regression line predicting `"Rent"` from `"Sqft"`. 
2. The slope of the regression line predicting `"Sqft"` from `"Rent"`. 
3. The slope of the regression like predicting `"Rent"` from `"Bed"`
4. The slope of the regression line predicting `"Bed"` from `"Rent"`.

Note that we don't have enough information to calculate all of these slopes, but you should be able to answer the questions below based not on calculations, but on the interpretation of what these slopes represent in the context of housing.
