According to Chebyshev's inequality, at least 80% of San Diego apartments have a monthly parking fee that falls between $30 and $70. 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the average monthly parking fee?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\$50$

We are given that the left and right bounds of Chebyshev's inequality are $30 and $70 respectively. Thus, to find the middle of the two, we compute the following equation (the midpoint equation):

$$\frac{\text{right} + \text{left}}{2}$$

$$\frac{70 + 30}{2} = 50$$

Therefore, $50$ is the average monthly parking fee.

<average>92</average>

What is the standard deviation of monthly parking fees?

( ) $\frac{20}{\sqrt{5}}$
( ) $\frac{40}{\sqrt{5}}$
( ) $20\sqrt{5}$
( ) $20\sqrt{5}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{20}{\sqrt{5}}$

Chebyshev's inequality states that at least $1 - \frac{1}{z^2}$ of values are within $z$ standard deviations of the mean. In addition, $z$ can be represented as $\frac{\text{bound} - \text{mean of x}}{\text{SD of x}}$. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation like so:
$$\frac{4}{5} = 1 - \frac{1}{(\frac{\text{bound} - \text{mean of x}}{\text{SD of x}})^2}$$

Then, we can solve:
$$\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{(\frac{\text{bound} - \text{mean of x}}{\text{SD of x}})^2}$$

Now since we know both bounds, we can plug one of them in. Since the mean was computed in the earlier step, we also plug this in.

$$\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{(\frac{70 - 50}{\text{SD of x}})^2}$$
$$5 = (\frac{20}{\text{SD of x}})^2$$
$$\sqrt{5} = \frac{20}{\text{SD of x}}$$
$$\text{SD of x} = \frac{20}{\sqrt{5}}$$

<average>70</average>
