# BEGIN PROB

We wish to compare the average rent for studio apartments in different complexes. 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Our goal is to create a DataFrame `studio_avg` where each complex with studio apartments appears once. The DataFrame should include a column named `"Rent"` that contains the average rent for all studio apartments in that complex. For each of the following strategies, determine if the code provided works as intended, gives an incorrect answer, or errors. 

(i)
```py
studio = apts[apts.get("Bed") == "Studio"]
studio_avg = studio.groupby("Complex").mean().reset_index()
```

( ) Works as intended
( ) Gives an incorrect answer
( ) Errors

(ii)
```py
studio_avg = apts.groupby("Complex").min().reset_index()
```

( ) Works as intended
( ) Gives an incorrect answer
( ) Errors

(iii)
```py
grouped = apts.groupby(["Bed", "Complex"]).mean().reset_index()
studio_avg = grouped[grouped.get("Bed") == "Studio"]
```

( ) Works as intended
( ) Gives an incorrect answer
( ) Errors

(iv)
```py
grouped = apts.groupby("Complex").mean().reset_index()
studio_avg = grouped[grouped.get("Bed") == "Studio"]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- **(i) Works as intended**
- **(ii) Gives an incorrect answer**
- **(iii) Works as intended**
- **(iv) Errors**

(i) `studio` is set to a DataFrame that is queried from the `apts` DataFrame so that it contains only rows that have the `"Studio"` value in `"Bed"`. Then, with `studio`, it groups by the `"Complex"` and aggregates by the mean. Finally, it resets its index. Since we have a DataFrame that only has `"Studio"`s , grouping by the `"Complex"` will take the mean of every numerical column - including the rent - in the DataFrame per `"Complex"`, effectively reaching our goal. 

<average>96</average>

<br><br>

(ii) `studio_avg` is created by grouping `"Complex"` and aggregating by the minimum. However, as the question asks for the **average rent**, getting the minimum rent of every complex does not reach the conclusion the question asks for.

<average>95</average>

<br><br>

(iii) `grouped` is made through first grouping by both the `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` columns then taking the mean and resetting the index. Since we are grouping by both of these columns, we separate each type of `"Bed"` by the `"Complex"` it belongs to while aggregating by the mean for every numerical column. After resetting the index, we are left with a DataFrame that contains the mean of every `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` combination. A sample of the DataFrame might look like this:

| Bed | Complex | Rent | ... |
|-----|---------|------|-----|
| One | Costa Verde Village | 3200 | ... |
| One | Westwood | 3000 | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

<center>(<em>Note: This is not an accurate representation of the DataFrame's true values at all!</em>)</center>

Then, when we assign `studio_avg`, we take this DataFrame and only get the rows in which `grouped`'s `"Bed"` column contains `"Studio"`. As we already `.groupby()`'d and aggregated by the mean for each `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` pair, we arrive at the solution the question requests for.

<average>84</average>

<br><br>

(iv) For this `grouped`, we only `.groupby()` the `"Complex"` column, aggregate by the mean, and reset index. Then, we attempt to assign `studio_avg` to the resulting DataFrame of a query from our `grouped` DataFrame. However, this wouldn't work at all because when we grouped by `"Complex"` and aggregated by the mean to create `grouped`, the `.groupby()` removed our `"Bed"` column since it isn't numerical. Therefore, when we attempt to query by `"Bed"`, babypandas cannot locate such column since it was removed - resulting in an error.

<average>60</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Consider the DataFrame `alternate_approach` defined as follows

```py
grouped = apts.groupby(["Bed", "Complex"]).mean().reset_index()
alternate_approach = grouped.groupby("Complex").min()
```

Suppose that the `"Rent"` column of `alternate_approach` has all the same values as the `"Rent"` column of `studio_avg`, where `studio_avg` is the DataFrame described in part \(a\). Which of the following are valid conclusions about `apts`? Select all that apply.

[ ] No complexes have studio apartments.
[ ] Every complex has at least one studio apartment.
[ ] Every complex has exactly one studio apartment.
[ ] Some complexes have only studio apartments.
[ ] In every complex, the average price of a studio apartment is less than or equal to the average price of a one bedroom apartment.
[ ] In every complex, the single cheapest apartment is a studio apartment.
[ ] None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Options 2 and 5

`alternate approach` first groups by `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` , takes the mean of all the columns, and resets the index such that `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` are no longer indexes. Now there is one row per `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` combination that exists in `apts` and all columns contain the mean value for each of these `"Bed"` and `"Complex"` combinations. Then it groups by `"Complex"` again, taking the minimum value of all columns. The output is a DataFrame indexed by `"Complex"` where the `"Rent"`column contains the minimum rent (from of all the average prices for each type of `"Bed"`). 

- Option 1 is incorrect. This is not necessarily true. The `"Rent"` column in `alternate_approach`in contains the minimum of all the average prices for each type of `"Bed"` and the `"Rent"` column in `"studio_avg"` contains the average rent for studios in each type of complex. Even though they contain the same values, this does not mean that no studios exist in any complexes. If this were the case, `studio_avg` would be an empty DataFrame and `alternate_approach` would not be.
- Option 2 is correct. If these columns are the same, that means that for each complex, there must at least one studio apartment. If this was not the case and there were complexes with no studio apartments, complexes that may appear in `alternate_approach` would not appear in `studio_avg`.
- Option 3 is incorrect. This is not necessarily true. Complexes can have more than one studio. `studio_avg` has  the average of all these studios for each complex and `alternate_approach` will have the minimum rent (from all the average prices for each type of bedroom). Just because the columns are the same does not mean that there is only one studio per complex.
- Option 4 is incorrect. This is not necessarily true. Just because the columns are the same does not mean that complexes only have studios. Perhaps studios just have the minimum rent on average across all complexes as explored in Option 5 below.
- Option 5 is correct. `studio_avg` contains the average price for a studio in each complex. `alternate_approach` contains the minimum rent from the average rents of all types of bedrooms for each complex. Since these columns are the same, this means that the average price of a studio must be lower (or equal to) the average price of a one bedroom (or any other type of bedroom) for all the rent values in `alternate_approach` to align with all the values in `studio_avg`.
- Option 6 is incorrect. As shown above, there are correct answers to this question.

Which data visualization should we use to compare the average prices of studio apartments across complexes?

( ) Scatter plot
( ) Line chart
( ) Bar chart
( ) Histogram

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Bar chart

Each complex is a categorical data type, so we should use a bar chart to compare average prices.

- Scatter plots are between two numerical variables.
- Line charts are typically used to depict changes throughout time.
- Histograms are used to depict frequency of distribution.
