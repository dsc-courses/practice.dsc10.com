You want to know how much extra it costs, on average, to have a washer and dryer in your apartment. Since this cost is built into the monthly rent, it isn't clear how much of your rent will be going towards this convenience. You decide to bootstrap the data in `apts` to estimate the average monthly cost of having in-unit laundry.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks to generate 10,000 bootstrapped estimates for the average montly cost of in-unit laundry.

```py
yes = apts[apts.get("Laundry")]
no = apts[apts.get("Laundry") == False]
laundry_stats = np.array([])
for i in np.arange(10000):
    yes_resample = yes.sample(__(a)__, __(b)__)
    no_resample = no.sample(__(c)__, __(d)__)
    one_stat = __(e)__
    laundry_stats = np.append(laundry_stats, one_stat)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- \(a\): `yes.shape[0]`
- \(b\): `replace=True`
- \(c\): `no.shape[0]`
- \(d\): `replace=True`
- \(e\): `yes_resample.get("Rent").mean() - no_resample.get("Rent").mean()`

For both `yes_resample` and `no_resample`, we need to use their respective DataFrames to create a bootstrapped estimate. Therefore, we randomly sample from their respective DataFrames with replacement (the law of bootstrap). Then, to calculate the test statistic, we need to look back at what the question asks of us: to estimate the **average monthly cost of having in-unit laundry**, so we subtract the mean of the bootstrapped estimate for `no` (`no_resample`) from the mean of the bootstrapped estimate for `yes` (`yes_resample`).

What if you wanted to instead estimate the average **yearly** cost of having in-unit laundry?

(i) Below, change the blank \(e\), such that the procedure not generates 10,000 bootstrapped estimates for the average **yearly** cost of in-unit laundry.

(ii) Suppose you ran your original code from part \(a\) and used the results to calculate a confidence interval for the average **monthly** cost of in-unit laundry, which came out to be 

$$[L_M, R_M].$$

Then, you changed blank \(e\) as you described above, and ran the code again to calculate a different confidence interval for the average **yearly** cost of in-unit laundry, which came out to be

$$[L_Y, R_Y]$$.

Which of the following is the best description of the relationship between the endpoints of these confidence intervals? Note that the symbol $\approx$ means "approximately equal."

( ) $L_Y = 12 \cdot L_M$ and $R_Y = 12 \cdot R_M$
( ) $L_Y \approx 12 \cdot L_M$ and $R_Y \approx 12 \cdot R_M$
( ) $L_M = 12 \cdot L_Y$ and $R_M = 12 \cdot R_Y$
( ) $L_M \approx 12 \cdot L_Y$ and $R_M \approx 12 \cdot R_Y$
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $L_Y \approx 12 \cdot L_M$ and $R_Y \approx 12 \cdot R_M$

For both $L_Y$ and $R_Y$, we cannot say that we certainly know that it will be precisely 12 times the value of the average monthly cost. Because every month and year has variablity/noise, we cannot say for certain that it will most definitely be 12 times the value of average monthly cost, but instead will probably be approximately equal.

The bottom two choices flip the inequality and state that the average monthly cost is 12 times the value of the average yearly cost, which would be vastly different from one another.

You're concerned about the validity of your estimates because you think bigger apartments are more likely to have in-unit laundry for one bedroom apartments only. 

If your concern is valid and it is true that bigger apartments are more likely to have in-unit laundry, how will your bootstrapped estimates for the average monthly cost of in-unit laundry for one bedroom apartments only compare to the values you computed in part \(a\) based on all the `apts`?

( ) The estimates will be about the same.
( ) The estimates will be generally larger than those you computed in part \(a\).
( ) The estimates will be generally smaller than those you computed in part \(a\).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** The estimates will be generally smaller than those you computed in part \(a\).

If we query the `yes` and `no` DataFrames to contain only one bedroom apartments, the average `"Rent"` of these two DataFrames will probably be smaller than the original DataFrames. Because these two DataFrames now have a smaller mean, their bootstraps are also likely to also be smaller than what it originally was. 

Another way we can think of it is by first calling our original `yes` and `no` DataFrames as `yes_population` and `no_population` respectively. Now, if we take `yes_population` and `no_population` on a histogram, we'll likely see higher magnitude `"Rent"` outliers. By removing these outliers, we are now in a scenario similar to what the question asks. By taking this smaller subset that doesn't have outliers and bootstrap, we will most likely get a smaller estimate than that seen from `yes_population` and `no_population` bootstraps.

Consider the distribution of `laundry_stats` as computed in part \(a\). How would this distribution change if we:

(i) Increased the number of repetitions to 100,000?

( ) The distribution would be wider.
( ) The distribution would be narrower.
( ) The distribution would not change significantly.

(ii) Started with only half of the rows in `apts`?

( ) The distribution would be wider.
( ) The distribution would be narrower.
( ) The distribution would not change significantly.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

- (i) The distribution would not change significantly.
- (ii) The distribution would be wider.

(i) When the number of repetitions are increased, the overall distribution will end up looking the same. If anything, increasing the number of repetitions would make the bootstrap distribution look more like the true population distribution. 

(ii) If only half of the rows are used, there would be more variability in the bootstrap, leading to a wider distribution.
