# BEGIN PROB

We want to use the data in `apts` to test the following hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis:** The rent of the apartments in UTC and the rents of the apartments in other neighborhoods come from the same distribution.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The rents of the apartments in UTC are **higher** than the rents of the apartments in other neighborhoods on average.

While we could answer this question with a permutation test, in this problem we will explore another way to test these hypotheses. Since this is a question of whether two samples come from the same unknown population distribution, we need to construct a "population" to sample from. We will construct our "population" in the same way as we would for a permutation test, except we will draw our sample differently. Instead of shuffling, we will draw our two samples **with replacement** from the constructed "population". We will use as our test statistic the difference in means between the two samples (in the order **UTC minus elsewhere**).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the data in `apts`, which has 800 rows, includes 85 apartments in UTC. Fill in the blanks below so that `p_val` evaluates to the p-value for this hypothesis test, which we will test according to the strategy outlined above.

```py
diffs = np.array([])
for i in np.arange(10000):
    utc_sample_mean = __(a)__
    elsewhere_sample_mean = __(b)__
    diffs = np.append(diffs, utc_sample_mean - elsewhere_sample_mean)
observed_utc_mean = __(c)__
observed_elsewhere_mean = __(d)__
observed_diff = observed_utc_mean - observed_elsewhere_mean
p_val = np.count_nonzero(diffs __(e)__ observed_diff) / 10000
```
