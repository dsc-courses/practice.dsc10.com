The table below shows the proportion of apartments of each type in each of three neighborhoods. Note that each column sums to 1.

| **Type** | **North Park** | **Chula Vista** | **La Jolla** |
|:---------|:--------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
| Studio   |     0.30       |      0.15       |     0.40     |
|One bedroom|    0.40       |      0.35       |     0.30     |
|Two bedroom|    0.20       |      0.25       |     0.15     |
|Three bedroom|  0.10       |      0.25       |     0.15     |

Find the total variation distance (TVD) between North Park and Chula Vista. Give your answer as an exact decimal.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.2$

To find the TVD, we take the absolute differences between North Park and Chula Vista for all rows, sum them, then cut the result in half.

$$\dfrac{|0.3 - 0.15| + |0.4 - 0.35| + |0.2 - 0.25| + |0.1 - 0.25|}{2} = \dfrac{0.15 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.15}{2} = \dfrac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$$

Which pair of neighborhoods is most similar in terms of types of housing, as measured by TVD? 

( ) North Park and Chula Vista
( ) North Park and La Jolla
( ) Chula Vista and La Jolla

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** North Park and La Jolla

The TVD between North Park and La Jolla is the lowest between all pairs of two of these three neighborhoods:

<br>

| **Pair** | **TVD** |
|:---------|:--------------:|
| North Park and Chula Vista  |    0.2     |
| North Park and La Jolla |    0.15      |
| Chula Vista and La Jolla |    0.25    |

<br>

This implies that the distributions of apartment types for North Park and La Jolla are the most similar.

25% of apartments in Little Italy are one bedroom apartments. Based on this information, what is the minimum and maximum possible TVD between North Park and Little Italy? Give your answers as exact decimals.

<center>Minimum: ______ Maximum: ______</center>

<br>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- Minimum: $0.15$
- Maximum: $0.65$

The minimum TVD is 0.15 because:

- One-Bedroom Apartments for North Park and Little Italy already have a gap of $|0.4 - 0.25| = 0.15$ 
- **A best-possible configuration** of the remaining $0.75$ of the Little Italy distribution (Studio: $0.3$, Two Bed: $0.2$, Three Bed: $0.25$) produces an additional $|0.3 - 0.3| + |0.2 - 0.2| + |0.1 - 0.25| = 0.15$ error against North Park.
- The TVD of this optimal scenario is $\frac{0.15 + 0.15}{2} = 0.15$.

The maximum TVD is 0.65 because:

- One-Bedroom Apartments for North Park and Little Italy already have a gap of $|0.4 - 0.25| = 0.15$ 
- **The worst-possible configuration** of the remaining $0.75$ of the Little Italy distribution (Studio: $0.0$, Two Bed: $0.0$, Three Bed: $0.75$) produces an additional $|0.3 - 0| + |0.2 - 0| + |0.1 - 0.75| = 1.15$ error against North Park.
- The TVD of this worst scenario is $\frac{0.15 + 1.15}{2} = 0.65$.
