Suppose you know the following information.

- The average monthly rent for the apartments in `apts` is $3,000 with a standard deviation of $400.
- The average size of the apartments in `apts` is 2,000 square feet, with a standard deviation of 100 square feet.
- The correlation coefficient between rent and square footage is 0.9.

For all parts of this quesiton, give your answer as an **integer**.

Suppose the rents are normally distributed. What is the rent below which 84% of apartments are priced?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $3,400

We can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to approximate this answer. The (68-95-99.7 rule)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20the%2068%E2%80%9395,two%2C%20and%20three%20standard%20deviations] is a handy shortcut for approximating how much data from a distribution lies below/above/within certain value ranges. It states that, for a normal distribution:

- Roughly 68% of the data will lie within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
- Roughly 95% of the data will lie within 2 standard deviations from the mean.
- Roughly 99.7% of the data will lie within 3 standard deviations from the mean.

The bottom 84% percent of our `apts` data is roughly equivalent to "all data that lies below 1 standard deviation above the mean." In this case, let the mean of our distribution be $3,000, and let the standard deviation be $400; the rent for which 84% of our apartments are priced is therefore $3,400.

Sophie's apartment rents for $5,000. What is this rent in standard units?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 5

Standard units (or Z-score) is the number of standard deviations an observation is away from the mean of a distribution. In this case, we want to find how many standard deviations ($400) that our observation ($5000) is away from the mean ($3000). The math works out to five standard deviations: 

$\frac{5000 - 3000}{400} = 5$

Based on what you know about the rent of Sophie's apartment, use the regression line to predict the square footage of Sophie's apartment.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 2450

The correlation coefficient of 0.9 tells us about the slope of the regression line to predict square footage from rent; this means that "for every standard unit traveled right in the x-direction (rent), the regression line heads 0.9 standard units up in the y-direction (square footage)." 

Sophie's apartment rent is $5000 (or five standard units in the x-direction, rent). So, to get our regresion line prediction for the square footage of Sophie's apartment, we should head $5 \cdot 0.9 = 4.5$ standard units upwards from the mean in the y-direction, square footage. The standard deviation for square footage is $100; this implies that the prediction for Sophie's apartment square footage should be $100 \cdot 4.5 = 450$ square feet above the mean (2000 square feet), totaling to a final prediction of 2450 square feet.

Sophie's apartment is actually 2,300 square feet. What is the residual of your prediction?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** -150

A residual just measures the difference between the *observed* and the *predicted* value. If our observation is 2300 square feet, and our prediction is 2450 square feet, our residual is then -150 square feet.

Cici's apartment is 1,800 square feet. Based on this information, use the regression line to predict the rent of Cici's apartment.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $2,280

The correlation coefficient of 0.9 *also* tells us about the slope of the regression line to predict rent from square footage; this means that "for every standard unit traveled right in the x-direction (square footage), the regression line heads 0.9 standard units up in the y-direction (rent)." 

Cici's apartment square footage is 1,800 square feet (or negative two standard units in the x-direction, square footage). So, to get our regresion line prediction for the rent of Cici's apartment, we should head $-2 \cdot 0.9 = -1.8$ standard units from the mean in the y-direction, rent. The standard deviation for rent is $400; this implies that the prediction for Cici's apartment rent should be $400 \cdot -1.8 = 720$ square feet below the mean (3000 dollars), totaling to a final prediction of $2280.
