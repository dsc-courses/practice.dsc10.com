You are given the following information about security deposits for a sample of 400 apartments in the Mission Hills neighborhood of San Diego:

- Mean deposit: $2,300
- Standard Deviation of deposits: $500

Using the fact that `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-0.8)` evaluates to about 0.21, construct a 58% confidence interval for the mean security deposit of all Mission Hills apartments. Below, give the endpoints of your confidence interval, both as integers.

Left endpoint: ____(a)____ <br>
Right endpoint: ____(b)____

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- **\(a\) $2280$**
- **\(b\) $2320$**

`scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-0.8)` tells us that from the bounds of $(-\inf, -0.8]$, the normal distribution has an area of $0.21$. Therefore, if we take it to the other side from $[0.8, \inf)$, it also has an area of $0.21$ due to the symmetrical property of the normal distribution. This means that the interval between $[-0.8, 0.8]$ has an area of $1 - 0.21 - 0.21 = 0.58$: the confidence interval we are aiming to find.

In the question, we are given the standard deviation of security deposits **in a sample**, meaning we need to find the standard deviation for the **population**. To find this, we use the following formula and compute:

$$\frac{\text{SD of sample}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}} = \frac{500}{\sqrt{400}} = \frac{500}{20} = 25$$. 

Now that we have the population standard deviation, we can calculate the endpoints of the confidence interval. 

Left endpoint:
$$2300 - \frac{4}{5} \cdot 25 = 2320$$

Right endpoint:
$$2300 + \frac{4}{5} \cdot 25 = 2280$$
