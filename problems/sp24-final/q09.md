For each expression below, determine the data type of the output and the value of the expression, if possible. If there is not enough information to determine the expression's value, write "Unknown" in the corresponding blank.

`apts.get("Rent").iloc[43] * 4 / 2`

<center>type: ____ value: ____</center>

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- type: **float**
- value: **Unknown**
  
We know that all values in the column `Rent` are `ints`. So, when we call `.iloc[43]` on this column (which grabs the 44th entry in the column), we know the result will be an `int`. We then perform some multiplication and division with this value. Importantly, when we divide an `int`, the type is automatically changed to a `float`, so the type of the final output will be a `float`. Since we do not explicitly know what the 44th entry in the `Rent` column is, the exact value of this `float` is unknown to us.

`apts.get("Neighborhood").iloc[2][-3]`

<center>type: ____ value: ____</center>


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- type: **str**
- value: **"w"**

This code takes the third entry (the entry at index 2) from the `Neighborhood` column of `apts`, which is a `str`, and it takes the third to last letter of that string. The third entry in the `Neighborhood` column is `'Midway'`, and the third to last letter of `'Midway'` is `'w'`. So, our result is a `string` with value `w`.

`(apts.get("Laundry") + 5).max()`

<center>type: ____ value: ____</center>


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- type: **int**
- value: **6**

This code deals with the `Laundry` column of `apts`, which is a Series of `True`s and `False`s. One property of `True`s and `False`s is that they are also interpreted by Python as ones and zeroes. So, the code `(apts.get("Laundry") + 5).max()` adds five to each of the ones and zeroes in this column, and then takes the maximum value from the column, which would be an `int` of value `6`.

`apts.get("Complex").str.contains("Verde")`

<center>type: ____ value: ____</center>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- type: **Series**
- value: **Unknown**

This code takes the column (series) `"Complex"` and returns a new series of `True` and `False` values. Each `True` in the new column is a result of an entry in the `"Complex"` column containing `"Verde"`. Each `False` in the new column is a result of an entry in the `"Complex"` column failing to contain `"Verde"`. Since we are not given the entirety of the `"Complex"` column, the exact value of the resulting series is unknown to us.

`apts.get("Sqft").median() > 1000`

<center>type: ____ value: ____</center>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- type: **bool**
- value: **Unknown**

This code finds the median of the column (series) `"Sqft"` and compares it to a value of 1000, resulting in a `bool` value of `True` or `False`. Since we do not know the median of the `"Sqft"` column, the exact value of the resulting code is unknown to us.
