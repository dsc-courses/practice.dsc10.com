The management of the Solazzo apartment complex is changing the comple's name to be the output of the following line of code. Write the new name of this complex as a string.

Note that the string method `.capitalize()` converts the first character of a string to uppercase.

```py
("Solazzo".replace("z", "ala" * 2)
          .replace("aa")[-1]
          .capitalize()
          .replace("o", "Jo"))
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** "LaJo"

Let's trace the steps:

We start with the original string: "Solazzo".

`"Solazzo".replace("z", "ala" * 2)` <br>
Replace every instance of "z" with "alaala" since "ala" * 2 = "alaala": "Solaalaalaalaalao"

`"Solaalaalaalaalao".split("aa")` <br>
Split the string by "aa": ["Sol", "l", "l", "l", "lao"]

`["Sol", "l", "l", "l", "lao"][-1]` <br>
Get the last element of the list: "lao"

`"lao".capitalize()` <br>
Uppercase the first character of the string: "Lao"

`"Lao".replace("o", "Jo")` <br>
Replace every instance of "o" with "Jo": "LaJo"

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** "MissMeMissMe"

Let's trace the steps:

We start with the original string: "Renaissance".

`"Renaissance".split("n")` <br>
Split the string by "n": ["Re", "aissa", "ce"]

`["Re", "aissa", "ce"][1]` <br>
Get the element in the 1st index of the list (the second element in the list): "aissa"

`"aissa" + e` <br>
Add an "e" to the end of the string: "aissae"

`("aissae") * 2` <br>
Repeat the string twice: "aissaeaissae"

`"aissaeaissae".replace("a", "M")` <br>
Replace every instance of "a" with "M": "MissMeMissMe"
