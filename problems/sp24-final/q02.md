Michelle and Abel are each touring apartments for where they might live next year. Michelle wants to be close to UCSD so she can attend classes easily. Abel is graduating and wants to live close to the beach so he can surf. Each person makes their own DataFrame (called `michelle` and `abel` respectively), to keep track of all the apartments that they toured. Both `michelle` and `abel` came from querying `apts`, so both DataFrames have the same columns and structure as `apts`.

Here are some details about the apartments they toured.

- Michelle toured **one bedroom and studio** apartments at 12 different complexes, or 24 apartments total.
- Abel toured **one bedroom and two bedroom** apartments at 20 different complexes, or 40 apartments total.
- There are 8 complexes that are near both UCSD and the beach, and both Michelle and Abel toured these complexes.

We'll assume for this problem only that there is just one apartment of each size available at each complex, so that if they both tour a one bedroom apartment at the same complex, it is the exact same apartment with the same `"Apartment ID"`.

What does the following expression evaluate to?

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <pre><code class="python">michelle.merge(abel,&nbsp;left_index=True,&nbsp;right_index=True).shape[0]</code></pre>
</div>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $8$

This expression uses the indices of `michelle` and `abel` to merge. Since both use the index of `"Apartment ID"` and we are assuming that there is only one apartment of each size available at each complex, we only need to see how many unique apartments `michelle` and `abel` share. Since there are 8 complexes that they both visited, only the one bedroom apartments in these complexes will be displayed in the resulting merged DataFrame. Therefore, we will only have 8 apartments, or 8 rows.

What does the following expression evaluate to?

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <pre><code class="python">
michelle.merge(abel,&nbsp;on="Bed").shape[0]
  </code></pre>
</div>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $240$

This expression merges on the `"Bed"` column, so we need to look at the data in this column for the two DataFrames. Within this column, `michelle` and `abel` share only one specific type of value: `"One"`. With the details that are given, `michelle` has 12 rows containing this value while `abel` has 20 rows containing this value. Since we are merging on this row, each row in `abel` that contains the `"One"` value will be matched with a row in `michelle` that also contains the value, meaning one row in `michelle` will turn into twelve after the merge.

Thus, to compute the total number of rows from this merge expression, we multiply the number of rows in `michelle` with the number of rows in `abel` that fit the cross-criteria of `"Bed"`. Numerically, this would be $12 \cdot 20 = 240$.

michelle.merge(abel,&nbsp;on="Complex").shape[0]
  </code></pre>
</div>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $32$

To approach this question, we first need to determine how many complexes Michelle and Abel have in common: 8. We also know that each complex was toured twice by both Michelle and Abel, so there are two copies of each complex in the `michelle` and `abel` DataFrames. Therefore, when we merge the DataFrames, the two copies of each complex will match with each other, effectively creating four copies for each complex from the original two. Since this is done for each complex, we have $8 \cdot (2 \cdot 2) = 32$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $800$

Since this question deals purely with the `abel` DataFrame, we need to fully understand what is inside it. There are 40 apartments (or rows): 20 one bedrooms and 20 two bedrooms. When we self-merge on the `"Bed"` column, it is imperative to know that every one bedroom apartment will be matched with the 20 other     one bedroom apartments (including itself)! This also goes for the two bedroom apartments. Therefore, we have $20 \cdot 20 + 20 \cdot 20 = 800$.
