Next year, six of the DSC tutors (Kathleen, Sophia, Ashley, Claire, and Vivian) want to rent a 3-bedroom apartment together. Each person will have a single roommate with whom they'll share a bedroom. Each person will have a single roommate with whom they'll share a bedroom. They determine the bedroom assignments randomly such that each possible arrangement is equally likely.

For both questions below, give your answer as a simplified fraction or exact decimal.

**Hint:** Both answers can be expressed in the form $\frac{1}{k}$ for an integer value of $k$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that Kathleen and Sophia are roommates?

**Hint:** Think about the problem from the perspective of Kathleen.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\displaystyle\frac{1}{5}$

From Kathleen's perspective, there are 5 tutors that are equally likely to become her roommate. So, the probability that Sophia ends up being Kathleen's roommate is $\displaystyle\frac{1}{5}$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that the bedroom assignments are the following: Kathleen with Sophia, Kate with Ashley, and Claire with Vivian?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{15}$

In order to get this combination of roommates, we can use similar logic as before. From Kathleen's perspective, there are 5 tutors that are equally likely to become her roommate. So, the probability that Sophia ends up being Kathleen's roommate is $\displaystyle\frac{1}{5}$. From there, we can view the situation from Kate's perspective; Kate sees that there are 3 potential roommates left (Ashley, Claire, Vivian). So, the probability that Sophia ends up being Kathleen's roommate (given Kathleen and Sophia are together) is $\displaystyle\frac{1}{3}$. After Kate chooses her roommate, Claire and Vivian end up together by process of elimination. We can multiply these two probabilities to recieve: $\displaystyle\frac{1}{5} \cdot \displaystyle\frac{1}{5} = \displaystyle\frac{1}{15}$.
