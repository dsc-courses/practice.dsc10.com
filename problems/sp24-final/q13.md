Values in the `"Bath"` column are `"One"`, `"One and a half"`, `"Two"`, `"Two and a half"`, and `"Three"`. Fill in the blank in the function `float_bath` that will convert any string from the `"Bath"` column into its corresponding number of bathrooms, as a float. For example, `float_bath("One and a half")` should return `1.5`. 

```py
def float_bath(s):
    if "One" in s:
        n_baths = 1
    elif "Two" in s:
        n_baths = 3
    else:
        n_baths = 3
    if "and a half" in s:
        __(a)__
    return n_baths
```

What goes in blank `(a)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `n_baths = n_baths + 0.5`

The behavior that we want this line of code to have is to work regardless if the bath string contains `"One"`, `"Two"`, or `"Three"`. This means we need to have some way of taking the value that `n_baths` is already assigned and adding 0.5 to it. So, our code should read `n_baths = n_baths + 0.5`.

Values in the `"Lease Term"` column are `"1 month"`, `"6 months"`, and `"1 year"`. Fill in the blanks in the function `int_lease()` that will convert any string from the `"Lease Term"` column to the corresponding length of the lease, in months, as an integer.

```py
def int_lease(s):
    if s[-1] == "r":
        return __(b)__
    else:
        return __(c)__
```

What goes in blanks `(b)` and `(c)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- `(b)`: `12`
- `(c)`: `int(s[0])`

The code in blank (b) will only be run if the last letter of `s` is `"r"`, which only happens when `s = "1 year"`. So, blank (b) should return `12`.

The code in blank (c) will run when `s` has any value other than `"1 year"`. This includes only two options: `1 month`, and `6 months`. In order to get the corresponding number of the months for these two string values, we just need to take the first character of the string and convert it from a `str` type to an `int` type. So, blank (c) should return `int(s[0])`.

Values in the `"Bed"` column are `"Studio"`, `"One"`, `"Two"`, and `"Three"`. The function `int_bed` provided below converts any string from the `"Bed"` column to the corresponding number of bedrooms, as an integer. Note that `"Studio"` apartments count as having 0 bedrooms.

```py
def int_bed(s):
    if s == "Studio":
        return 0
    elif s == "One":
        return 1
    elif s == "Two":
        return 2
    return 3
```

Using the provided `int_bed` function, write one line of code that modifies the `"Bed"` column of the `apts` DataFrame so that it contains integers instead of strings.

**Important:** We will assume throughout the rest of this exam that we have converted the `"Bed"` column of `apts` so that it now contains ints.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `apts = apts.assign(Bed = apts.get("Bed").apply(int_bed))`

The code above takes the "Bed" column, `apts.get("Bed")`, and uses `.apply(int_bed)`, which runs each entry through the `int_bed` function that we have defined above. All that is left is to save the result back to the dataframe; this can be done with `.assign()`.
