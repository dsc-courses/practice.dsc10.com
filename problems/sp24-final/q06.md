You want to use the data in `apts` to test both of the following pairs of hypotheses:

**Pair 1:**

- **Null Hypothesis**: In San Diego, the number of one bedroom apartments available for rent is **equal** to the number of two bedroom apartments available for rent.
- **Alternate Hypothesis**: In San Diego, the number of one bedroom apartments available for rent is **greater** to the number of two bedroom apartments available for rent.

**Pair 2:**

- **Null Hypothesis**: In San Diego, the number of one bedroom apartments available for rent is **equal** to the number of two bedroom apartments available for rent.
- **Alternate Hypothesis**: In San Diego, the number of one bedroom apartments available for rent is **not equal** to the number of two bedroom apartments available for rent.

In `apts`, there are 467 apartments that are either one bedroom or two bedroom apartments. You perform the following simulation under the assumption of the null hypothesis.

```py
prop_1bf = np.array([])
abs_diff = np.array([])
for i in np.arange(10000):
    prop = np.random.multinomial(467, [0.5, 0.5])[0]/467
    prop_1br = np.append(prop_1br, prop)
    abs_diff = np.append(abs_diff, np.abs(prop-0.5))
```

You then calculate some percentiles of `prop_1br`. The following four expressions all evaluate to True.

```py
np.percentiles(prop_1br, 2.5) == 0.4
np.percentiles(prop_1br, 5) == 0.42
np.percentiles(prop_1br, 95) == 0.58
np.percentiles(prop_1br, 97.5) == 0.6
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is `prop_1br.mean()` to two decimal places?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.5$

From the given percentiles, we can notice that since the distribution is symmetric around the mean, the mean should be around the 50th percentile. Given the symmetry and the percentiles around 0.5, we can infer that the mean should be very close to $0.5$.

Another way we can look at it is by noticing that `prop` is pulled from a $[0.5, 0.5]$ distribution (because we are simulating under the null hypotheses) in `np.random.multinomial()`. This means that its expected for most of the distribution to be from around $0.5$.

<average>84</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is `np.std(prop_1br)` to two decimal places?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.05$

If we look again at the percentiles, we notice that it seems to resemble a normal distribution. So by taking the mean and the 97.5th percentile, we can solve for the standard deviation. Since $[2.5, 97.5]$ is the 95% confidence interval, we can say that the 97.5th percentile is two standard deviations away from the mean (2.5 too!). Thus,

$$0.5 + 2 \cdot \text{SD} = 0.6$$

$\therefore$ Solving for SD, we get $\text{SD} = 0.05$

What is `np.percentile(abs_diff, 95)` to two decimal places?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $0.1$

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which simulated test statistics should be used to test the first pair of hypotheses?

( ) `prop_1br`
( ) `abs_diff`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `prop_1br`

Our first pair of hypotheses' alternative hypothesis asks if one number is **greater** than the other. Because of this, we can't use an absolute value test statistic to answer the question, since all absolute value cares about is the distance the simulation is from the null assumption, not whether one value is greater than the other.

<average>82</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which simulated test statistics should be used to test the second pair of hypotheses?

( ) `prop_1br`
( ) `abs_diff`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `abs_diff`

Our first pair of hypotheses' alternative hypothesis asks if one number is **not equal** to the other. Because of this, we have to use a test statistic that sees the distance both ways, not just in one direction. Therefore, we use the absolute value. 

<average>83</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Your observed data in `apts` is such that you reject the null for the first pair of hypotheses at the 5% significance level, but fail to reject the null for the second pair at the 5% significance level. What could the value of the following proportion have been?

$$\frac{\text{\# of one bedroom apartments in \texttt{apts}}}{\text{\# of one bedroom apartments in \texttt{apts}+ \# of two bedroom apartments in \texttt{apts}}}$$

Give your answer as a number to two decimal places.

**Answer:** $0.59$
