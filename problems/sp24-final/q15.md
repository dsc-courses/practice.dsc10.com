Imagine a DataFrame constructed from `apts` called `bedrooms`, which has one row for each bedroom in an apartment in `apts`. More specifically, a one bedroom apartment in `apts` will appear as one row in `bedrooms`, a two bedroom apartment in `apts` will appear as two rows in `bedrooms`, and a three bedroom apartment in `apts` will appear as three rows in `bedrooms`. Studio apartments will not appear in `bedrooms` at all.

The `"Apartment ID"` column of `bedrooms` contains the `"Apartment ID"` of the apartment in `apts`. Notice that this is not the index of `bedrooms` since these values are no longer unique. The `"Cost"` column of `bedrooms` contains the rent of the apartment divided by the number of bedrooms. All rows of `bedrooms` with a shared `"Apartment ID"` should therefore have the same value in the `"Cost"` column.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Recall that `apts` has 800 rows. How many rows does `bedrooms` have?

( ) 800
( ) More than 800.
( ) Less than 800.
( ) Not enough information.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Not enough information.

Suppose `no_studio` is defined as follows. (Remember, we previously converted the `"Beds"` column to integers.)

```py
no_studio = apts[apts.get("Bed") != 0]
```

Which of the following statements evaluate to the same value as the expression below?

```py
bedrooms.get("Cost").mean()
```

Select all that apply.

[ ] `no_studio.get("Rent").mean()`
[ ] `no_studio.get("Rent").sum() / apts.get("Bed").sum()`
[ ] `(no_studio.get("Rent") / no_studio.get("Bed")).mean()`
[ ] `(no_studio.get("Rent") / no_studio.get("Bed").sum()).sum()`
[ ] `no_studio.get("Rent").mean() / no_studio.get("Bed").mean()`
[ ] None of these.

**Answer:** Options 2, 4, and 5.
