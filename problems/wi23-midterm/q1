Which column would be an appropriate index for storms?

( ) `'Name'`
( ) `'Date'`
( ) `'Time'`
( ) `'LAtitude'`
( ) None of these 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** None of these. 

An appropriate index has to be unuique, it should not be repetitive so we do not know what exactly row of data the index refers to. In this case, all `'Name'`, `'Data'`,`'Time'` have repetitive values, therefore none of these would be an appropriate index.
