The most famous Hurricane Katrina took place in August, 2005. The DataFrame `katrina_05`
contains just the rows of `storms` corresponding to this hurricane, which we’ll call Katrina’05.

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `direction_array` evaluates to an array of
directions (each of which is`"NE"`, `"NW"`, `"SW"`, or `"SE"`) representing the movement of Katrina
’05 between each pair of consecutive data entries in `katrina_05`.

```py
    direction_array = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(1, ____(a)____):
        w = katrina_05.get("Latitude").____(b)____
        x = katrina_05.get("Longitude").____(c)____
        y = katrina_05.get("Latitude").____(d)____
        z = katrina_05.get("Longitude").____(e)____
        direction_array = np.append(direction_array, direction(w, x, y, z))
```

What goes in blank (a)? 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `katrina_05.shape[0]`

In this line of code we want to go through the entire Katrina’05 DataFrame. We are provided the inclusive start, but we need to find the exclusive stop, which would be the number of rows in the DataFrame. `katrina_05.shape[0]` takes the DataFrame, finds the shape, which is represented by: `(rows, columns)`, and then isolates the rows in the first index.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `iloc[i-1]`

In this line of code we want to find the latitude of the row we are in. The whole line of code: `katarina_05.get("Latitude").iloc[i-1]` isolates the column `'Latitude'` and uses `iloc`, which is a purely integer-location based indexing function, to select the element at position `i-1`. The reason we are doing `i-1` is because the for loop started an `np.array` at 1. For example, if we wanted the latitude at index 0 we would need to do `iloc[1-1]` to get the equivalent `iloc[0]`.

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `iloc[i-1]`

Similarily to part b, this line of code will find the longitude of the row we are in. The whole line of code: `katarina_05.get("Longitude").iloc[i-1]` isolates the column `'Longitude'` and uses `iloc`, which is a purely integer-location based indexing function, to select the element at position `i-1`. The reason we are doing `i-1` is because the for loop started an `np.array` at 1.

What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `iloc[i]`

Now we are trying to find the "next" latitude, which will be the next coordinate point that the storm `Katrina` moved to. This means we want to find the latitude **after** the one we found in part b. The whole line of code: `katarina_05.get("Latitude").iloc[i]` isolates the `"Latitude"` column, and uses `iloc` to choose the element at position `i`. Recall, the for loop starts at 1, so it will always be the "next" element comparatively to part b, where we substracted 1.

What goes in blank (e)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `iloc[i]`

Similarily to part d, we are trying to find the "next" longitude, which will be the next coordinate point that the storm `Katarina` moved to. This means we want to find the longitude **after** the one we found in part c. The whole line of code: `katarina_05.get("Longitude").iloc[i]` isolates the column `'Longitude'` and uses `iloc` to choose the element at position `i`. Recall, the for loop starts at 1, so it will always be the "next" element comparitively to part c, where we substracted 1.
