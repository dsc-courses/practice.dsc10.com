The DataFrame directors contains historical information about the director of the National
Hurricane Center (NHC). A preview of directors is shown below.

We would like to merge `storms` with `directors` to produce a DataFrame with the same
information as `storms` plus one additional column with the name of the director who was
leading the NHC at the time of each storm. However, when we try to merge with the
command shown below, Python fails to produce the desired DataFrame.

```py
directors.merge(storms, left_on="Tenure", right_on="Year")
```

Which of the following is a problem with our attempted merge? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] We cannot merge these two DataFrames because they have two completely different sets of column names.
[ ] We want to add information about the directors to storms, so we need to use storms as our left DataFrame. The command should start with `storms.merge(directors)`.
[ ] The `directors` DataFrame does not contain enough information to determine who was the director of the NHC at the time of each storm.
[ ] The `"Tenure"` column of directors contains a different data type than the `"Year"` column of storms.

**Answer:** Option 3 and Option 4

Recall that `left_df.merge(right_df, left_on='column_a', right_on='column_b')` merges `left_df` to the `right_df` and specifies which columns from the DataFrame to use as keys by using `left_on=` and `right_on=`. This means that `column_a` becomes the key for the left DataFrame and `column_b` becomes the key for the right DataFrame. The important part of this is `'column_a'` and `'column_b'` should be the same data type and contain the same information for the merge to be successful.

Looking at the columns `"Tenure"` and `"Year"` we can see that `"Tenure"` contains a string and `"Year"` contains an int. Furthermore, `"Tenure"` contains a range of years, whereas `"Year"` contains one year. This means that the content and data types for these two columns are different. The merge will fail giving a `ValueError`. This also demonstrates how Option 4 is correct.

Since `directors` gives an error it doesn't contain information about the directors of the NHC at the time of each storm, which means Option 3 is correct.

**Option 1:** Is incorrect because you can merge DataFrames with different column names using `left_on` and `right_on`.

**Option 2:** Is incorrect because regardless of the `left` or `right` DataFrames if done correctly they will merge together. This means the order of the DataFrames does not make an impact.
