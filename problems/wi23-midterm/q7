The most famous Hurricane Katrina took place in August, 2005. The DataFrame `katrina_05`
contains just the rows of storms corresponding to this hurricane, which we’ll call Katrina
’05.

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `direction_array` evaluates to an array of
directions (each of which is`"NE"`, `"NW"`, `"SW"`, or `"SE"`) representing the movement of Katrina
’05 between each pair of consecutive data entries in `katrina_05`.

```py
    direction_array = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(1, ____(a)____):
        w = katrina_05.get("Latitude").____(b)____
        x = katrina_05.get("Longitude").____(c)____
        y = katrina_05.get("Latitude").____(d)____
        z = katrina_05.get("Longitude").____(e)____
        direction_array = np.append(direction_array, direction(w, x, y, z))
```

**a)** What goes in blank (a)? 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**katrina_05.shape[0]

In this line of code, `np.arange(start, stop)`, start = 1, while stop is the number of rows in the dataframe.
