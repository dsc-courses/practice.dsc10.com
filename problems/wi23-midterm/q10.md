Recall that all the named storms in `storms` occurred between 1965 and 2015, a fifty-year
time period.

Below is a histogram and the code that produced it. Use it to answer the questions that
follow.

```py
    (storms.groupby(["Name", "Year"]).count()
        .reset_index()
        .plot(kind="hist", y="Year",
            density=True, ec="w",
            bins=np.arange(1965, 2020, 5)));
```

Approximately 55 percent of named storms in this fifty-year time period
occurred in 1995 or later. Give your answer to the nearest multiple of five.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 55

For the left-hand portion that occured before 1995, this part is roughly a triangle, so we calculate the area of the rectangle using width x height, and subtract it from 1, which is the total. 

$1-(1995-1965)*0.015=0.55=55%$

b) True or False? The line plot generated by the code below will have no downward-sloping
segments after 1995.

```py
    (storms.groupby(["Name", "Year"]).count()
        .reset_index()
        .groupby("Year").count()
        .plot(kind="line", y="Name");
```

( ) True
( ) False


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

The previous histogram shows upward-sloping segments for each 5-year period after 1995, however, we are now ploting a line graph that shows a continuous timeline. Thus, there may be downward-sloping that happens within any 5-year periods.
