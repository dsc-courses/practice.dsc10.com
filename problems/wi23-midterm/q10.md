Recall that all the named storms in `storms` occurred between 1965 and 2015, a fifty-year
time period.

Below is a histogram and the code that produced it. Use it to answer the questions that
follow.

```py
    (storms.groupby(["Name", "Year"]).count()
        .reset_index()
        .plot(kind="hist", y="Year",
            density=True, ec="w",
            bins=np.arange(1965, 2020, 5)));
```

Approximately __(a)__ percent of named storms in this fifty-year time period
occurred in 1995 or later. Give your answer to the nearest multiple of five.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 55

We can find the percentage of named storms by using the fact: a histograms' area is always normalized to 1. This means we can calculate the area of the rectangle, also known as width * height, to the left of 1995. The height, which is the frequency, is about 0.015 and the width is the difference between 1995 and 1965. This gives us: $1 - (1995 - 1965) * 0.015 = 0.55$. Next to convert this to a percentage we multiply by 100, giving us: $0.55 * 100 = 55\%$.

True or False? The line plot generated by the code below will have no downward-sloping
segments after 1995.

```py
    (storms.groupby(["Name", "Year"]).count()
        .reset_index()
        .groupby("Year").count()
        .plot(kind="line", y="Name");
```

( ) True
( ) False


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

The previous histogram shows upward-sloping segments for each 5-year period after 1995; however, we are now ploting a line graph that shows a continuous timeline. Thus, there may be downward-sloping that happens within any 5-year periods. 

<average>51</average>
