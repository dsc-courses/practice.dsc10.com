The DataFrame amelia was created by the code below, and is shown in its entirety.

```py
amelia = (storms[(storms.get("Name") == "AMELIA") &
         (storms.get("Year") == 1978)]
         .get(["Year", "Month", "Day", "Time",
         "Status", "Latitude", "Longitude"]))
```

Use the space provided to show the DataFrame that results from
```py
        amelia.groupby("Status").max().
```
The column labels should go in the top row, and the row labels (`index`) should go in the
leftmost row. You may not need to use all the rows and columns provided.

**Answer:**

|Status|Year|Month|Day|Time|Latitude|Longtitude|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|TS|1978|7|31|12pm|28.0N|98.2W|
|TD|1978|8|31|6pm|29.3N|99.2W|


Recall that `groupby` sets the index, so `'Status'` would go to the leftmost row and be bolded. Then, we find the maximum number for each column. 

For `Status`, both `TD` and `TS` starts with the letter T, yet `S` is an alphabet larger than `D`, therefore `TS` should be on the first row. For the rest of the data, we find the maximum values for each column.
