Storm forecasters are very interested in the direction in which a tropical storm moves. This
direction of movement can be determined by looking at two consecutive rows in `storms` that
correspond to the same storm.

The function `direction` takes as input four values: the latitude and longitude of a data
entry for one storm, and the latitude and longitude of the next data entry for that same
storm. The function should return the direction in which the storm moved in the period of
time between the two data entries. The return value should be one of the following strings:

- `"NE"` for Northeastern movement,
- `"NW"` for Northwestern movement,
- `"SW"` for Southwestern movement, or
- `"SE"` for Southeastern movement

<br>

For example, `direction(23.1, 75.1, 23.4, 75.7)` should return `"NW"`.
If the storm happened to move *directly* North, South, East, or West, or if the storm did not
move at all, the function may return any one of `"NE"`, `"NW"`, `"SW"`, or `"SE"`.
Fill in the blanks in the function `direction` below. It may help to refer to the images on
Page 5.

```py
def direction(old_lat, old_long, new_lat, new_long):
    if old_lat > new_lat and old_long > new_long:
        return ____(a)____
    elif old_lat < new_lat and old_long < new_long:
        return ____(b)____
    elif old_lat > new_lat:
        return ____(c)____
    else:
        return ____(d)____
```

What goes in blank (a)? 

( ) `"NE"`
( ) `"NW"`
( ) `"SW"`
( ) `"SE"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"SE"`

According to the given example that `direction(23.1, 75.1, 23.4, 75.7)` should return `"NW"`, we learn that having an `old_lat` < `new_lat` (in the example: $23.1 < 23.4$) causes for the storm to move North and that having a `old_long` < `new_long` (in the example: $75.1 < 75.7$) causes for the storm to move West. This tells us if `old_lat` > `new_lat` then the storm will move South, the opposite direction of North, and if `old_long` > `new_long` then the storm will move East, the opposite direction of West.

The if statement is looking for the direction where (`old_lat` > `new_lat` and `old_long` > `new_long`), so from above we can tell it is moving Southeast. Remember both conditions must be satisfied for this if statement to execute.

What goes in blank (b)? 

( ) `"NE"`
( ) `"NW"`
( ) `"SW"`
( ) `"SE"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"NW"`

Recall from the previous section the logic that:

- North: `old_lat` < `new_lat`
- South: `old_lat` > `new_lat`
- East: `old_long` > `new_long`
- West: `old_long` < `new_long`

This means we are looking for the directions that satisfy the `elif` statement: `old_lat < new_lat` and `old_long < new_long`. Looking at our logic the statement is satisfied by the direction Northwest.

What goes in blank (c)? 

( ) `"NE"`
( ) `"NW"`
( ) `"SW"`
( ) `"SE"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"SW"`

We know the answers cannot be `'SE'` or `'NW'` because the if statement and elif statement above the one we are currently working in will catch those. This tells us we are either working with `'SW'` or `'NE'`. From the logic we established in the previous subparts we know when `'old_lat'` > `'new_lat'` we know the storm is going in the Southern direction. This means the only possible answer is `'SW'`.

What goes in blank (d)? 

( ) `"NE"`
( ) `"NW"`
( ) `"SW"`
( ) `"SE"`


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"NE"`

The only option we have left is `'NE'`. Remember than Python if statements will run every single `if`, and if none of them are triggered then it will move to the `elif` statements, and if none of those are triggered then it will finally run the `else` statement. That means whatever direction not used in parts a, b, and c needs to be used here.
