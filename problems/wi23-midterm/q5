Latitude measures distance from the equator in the north or south direction. Longitude
measures distance from the prime meridian in the east or west direction.

Since all of the United States lies north of the equator and west of the prime meridian,
the last character of each string in the `"Latitude"` column of `storms` is `"N"`, and the last
character of each string in the `"Longitude"` column is `"W"`. This means that we can refer
to the latitude and longitude of US locations by their numerical values alone, without the
directions `"N"` and `"W"`. The map below shows the latitude and longitude of the continental
United States in numerical values only.

(a) Complete the function lat long numerical that takes as input a string representing a
value from either the "Latitude" or "Longitude" column of storms, and returns that
latitude or longitude as a float. For example, lat long numerical(34.1N) should
return 34.1.

```py
    def lat_long_numerical(lat_long):
        return ________
```

Hint: The string method `.strip` takes as input a string of characters and removes all
instances of those characters at the beginning and end of the string. For example,
`"www.dsc10.com".strip("cmowz.")` evaluates to `"dsc10"`.

What goes in the blank? To earn credit, your answer **must** use the string method .strip.



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** float(lat_long.strip("NW"))

According to the hint, `.strip` takes as input a string of characters and removes all instances of those characters at the beginning and the end of the string. Since we want to refer to only the numerical values for latitude and longtitude, we choose to take the input `lat_long` and remove the `N` and `W inside. Then, we return the value to a float number.

Assume that lat long numerical has been correctly implemented. Which of the following correctly replaces the strings in the "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns of storms with float values? Select all that apply. 

( ) Option 1
( ) Option 2
( ) Option 3

**Important!** For the rest of the exam, assume that the "Latitude" and "Longitude"
columns of storms now have numerical entries.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 1 and Option 3

All of the options applied the function `lat_long_numerical`.

Option 1 is correct because it then deletes the original "latitude" and "longtitude", then assigns the new set to be the float numbers.

Option 3 is correct because it replaces strings in "latitude" and "longtitude".

However, Option 2 is incorrect since after assigning the values in "latitude" and "longtitude", it drops them, thus deleting the columns we need.
