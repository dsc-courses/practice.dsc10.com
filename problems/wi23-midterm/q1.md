Which column would be an appropriate index for storms?

( ) `'Name'`
( ) `'Date'`
( ) `'Time'`
( ) `'Latitude'`
( ) None of these 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** None of these. 

An index should be unique. In this case `'Name'`, `'Date'`, `'Time'`, and `'Latitude'` have repetative values, which does **not** make them unique. Remember `'Name'` will be reused every six years, multiple hurricanes could happen on the same date, time, or latitude.
