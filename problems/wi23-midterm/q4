Suppose there are `n` different storms included in storms.
Say we create a new DataFrame from `storms` by adding a column called `"Duration"` that
contains the number of minutes since the first data entry for that storm, as an `int`. The
first few rows of this new DataFrame are shown below.

Next we sort this DataFrame in ascending order of `"Duration"` and save the result as
`storms by duration`. Which of the following statements must be true? **Select all that
apply.**

( ) The first n rows of storms by duration will all correspond to different storms, because
they will contain the first reading from each storm in the data set.
( ) The last n rows of storms by duration will all correspond to different storms, because
they will contain the last reading from each storm in the data set.
( ) `storms by duration` will contain exactly n rows.
( ) len(storms by duration.take(np.arange(n)).get("Name").unique()) will evaluate
to n.

**Answer:** The first n rows of storms by duration will all correspond to different storms, because
they will contain the first reading from each storm in the data set.

After adding `Duration` to the last column, only 1 row of data for each storm happens to have the shortest duration. Hence, after we sort the dataframe in ascending order, we will get each storm's shortest duration for the first n rows. 

Option B is incorrect because it misinterprets the question. 

Option C is incorrect since there are not necessarily n rows. Indeed, there should be more than n row, since the same storm may occur in different times. According to the given dataframe, simply the storm `Anna` occured 3 different times on August 21, 1965 without sorting. 

Option D is incorrect.
