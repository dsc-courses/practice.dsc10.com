Suppose there are `n` different storms included in `storms`.
Say we create a new DataFrame from `storms` by adding a column called `'Duration'` that
contains the number of minutes since the first data entry for that storm, as an `int`. The
first few rows of this new DataFrame are shown below.

<br>

Next we sort this DataFrame in ascending order of `'Duration'` and save the result as
`storms_by_duration`. Which of the following statements must be true? **Select all that
apply.**

[ ] The first `n` rows of `storms_by_duration` will all correspond to different storms, because they will contain the first reading from each storm in the data set.
[ ] The last `n` rows of `storms_by_duration` will all correspond to different storms, because they will contain the last reading from each storm in the data set.
[ ] `storms_by_duration` will contain exactly n rows.
[ ] `len(storms_by_duration.take(np.arange(n)).get("Name").unique())` will evaluate to `n`.

**Answer:** "The first `n` rows of `storms_by_duration` will all correspond to different storms, because
they will contain the first reading from each storm in the data set."

Let's first analyze the directions. According to the directions, we added the column `'Duration'`, so we know how long each storm lasted. Then we sorted the DataFrame in ascending order, which will put the storms with the shortest duration at the top.

Each row will be tied to a unique storm because each storm can only have one minimum. This means `storms_by_duration`'s first `n` rows will contain the shortest duration for each unique storm, which corresponds to the first option.

**Option 2:** This is incorrect because even though the DataFrame is sorted in ascending order it is possible for a storm to have multiple close values in `'Duration'`, which does not guarantee unique storms in the last `n` rows. For example if you had the storm `'alice'`, which one time had a duration of 60 and the longest duration of 62. The values will be sorted such that 60 will come before 62, but they are within the last `n` values of the DataFrame, causing `'alice'` to appear twice.

**Option 3:** This is incorrect because there can be more than `n` rows. It is possible that a storm appears multiple times. For example the storm `Anna` occured three different times on August 21, 1965 without sorting.

**Option 4:** This is incorrect. The code written will take the first `n` rows of the table, get the names, and find the number of unique named storms. Names are not unique, so it is possible for the storms to share the same name. This can be seen in the DataFrame example above.
