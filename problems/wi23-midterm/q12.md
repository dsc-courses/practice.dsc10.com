Hurricane forecasters use complex models to simulate hurricanes. Suppose a forecaster
simulates 10,000 hurricanes and keeps track of the state where each hurricane made
landfall in an array called `landfalls`. Each element of `landfalls` is a string, which
is either the full name of a US state or the string "None" if the storm did not hit land
in the simulation.

The forecaster wants to use the results of their simulation to estimate the probability
that a given storm hits Georgia. Write one line of Python code that approximates this
probability, using the data in `landfalls`.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** np.count nonzero(landfalls == "Georgia") / 10000

The probability would be the number of times the storm hits Georgia over the total times of hurricanes, which is 10000. Since each element of `landfills` is a string, so we calculate the non-zero entries inside `landfills` using `np.count_nonzero`, then divide by 10000.

Oh no, a hurricane is forming! Experts predict that the storm has a 45% chance of
hitting Florida, a 25% chance of hitting Georgia, a 5% chance of hitting South Carolina,
and a 25% chance of not making landfall at all.

Fast forward: the storm made landfall. Assuming the expert predictions were correct, what is the probability that the storm hit Georgia? Give your answer as a **fully simplified fraction** between 0 and 1.

**Hint:** The answer is not 1/4 , or 25%


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** \fraction{1}{3}
