The code below defines a variable called `month formed`.

```py
month_formed = (storms.groupby(["Name", "Year"]).min()
                      .reset_index()
                      .groupby("Month").count()
                      .get("Name"))
```

What is the data type of `month formed`?

( ) int
( ) str
( ) Series
( ) Dataframe
( ) None of these


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Series 

First, we used `groupby` and `min` to find the minimum values in the dataframe `storms` indexed by `"Name"` and `"Year"`. Then, we reset the index and `count` the number of times the values occur induexed by `"Month"`. In the end, we `get` one column `"Name"`, which is a Series.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following expressions evaluates to the proportion of storms in our data
set that were formed in August?

( ) month formed.loc[8]/month formed.sum()
( ) month formed.iloc[7]/month formed.sum()
( ) month formed[month formed.index == 8].shape[0]/month formed.sum()
( ) month formed[month formed.get("Month") == 8].shape[0]/month formed.sum()


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** option 1: month formed.loc[8]/month formed.sum()

Option 1 is correct. Recall that `loc` is label-based and refers to the label, so we are able to locate `loc[8]` to August. 

Option 2 is incorrect. Recall that `iloc` is index-based and refers to a value's index. However, we are not certain that the first month with storms starts in January, or they may be no storms during a month that is before August.
