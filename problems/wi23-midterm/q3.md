The DataFrame `amelia` was created by the code below, and is shown in its entirety.

```py
amelia = (storms[(storms.get("Name") == "AMELIA") &
         (storms.get("Year") == 1978)]
         .get(["Year", "Month", "Day", "Time",
         "Status", "Latitude", "Longitude"]))
```

<br>

Use the space provided to show the DataFrame that results from
```py
        amelia.groupby("Status").max()
```
The column labels should go in the top row, and the row labels (index) should go in the
leftmost row. You may not need to use all the rows and columns provided.

**Answer:**

|Status|Year|Month|Day|Time|Latitude|Longtitude|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|TD|1978|8|31|6pm|29.3N|99.2W|
|TS|1978|7|31|6am|28.0N|98.2W|

Remember that calling `.groupby('column name')` sets the column name to the index. This means the `'Status'` column will become the new bolded index, which is found in the leftmost column of the data frame. Another thing to know is Python will organize strings in the **index** in alphabetical order, so for example `TS` and `TD` both start with `T`, but `D` comes sooner in the alphabet than `S`, which makes row `TD` come **before** row `TS`.

Next it is important to look at the `.max()`, which tells us that we want the maximum element of each column that correspond to the unique `'Status'`. Recall how `.max()` interacts with strings: `.max()` will organize strings in the columns in descending order, so the last alphabetically/numerically.
