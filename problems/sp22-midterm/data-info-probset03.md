After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, UCSD's annual music festival, the Sun God festival, is back this year! In this exam, we'll be looking at a DataFrame named `sungod` that contains information on the artists who have performed at Sun God in years past. The columns are:

- `'Year'` (`int`): the year of the festival
- `'Artist'` (`str`): the name of the artist
- `'Appearance_Order'` (`int`): the order in which the artist appeared in that year's festival (1 means they came onstage first)

Assume we have already run `import babypandas as bpd` and `import numpy as np`.
