In 2014, the UCSD administration made some important changes to Sun God policies, including:

1. eliminating guest tickets for non-students,
2. increasing security, and
3. introducing on-site medical care.
   
These changes were implemented because of incidents related to drug and alcohol abuse at the festival. At the 2013 Sun God festival, 48 students were hospitalized, and at the 2014 festival, only 8 students were hospitalized. Assuming there was no change in the total number of attendees from 2013 to 2014, which of the following statements is correct?

( ) We cannot be sure if there is an association between administrative changes and hospitalizations.
( ) There is an association between administrative changes and hospitalizations. One or more of the administrative changes is responsible for the decrease in hospitalizations, but since several administrative changes happened at the same time, we can’t be sure of which one to credit with the reduction in hospitalizations.
( ) There is an association between administrative changes and hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of the administrative changes are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.
( ) None of the above.

**Answer: ** There is an association between administrative changes and hospitalizations. We can’t be sure if any of the administrative changes are responsible for the reduction in hospitalizations.

We know there is an association between administrative changes and hospitalizations because the number of hospitalized students dropped after the changes went into effect. 

However, since no randomized controlled trial was done, we can't be sure of the reason for the reduction in hospitalizations. For example, maybe there were fewer hospitalizations because a new flavor of sparkling water came out in 2014, and people drank that instead of alcohol. We just don't know enough to conclude any causal explanation for the reduction in hospitalizations.
