# BEGIN PROB
We collect data on the play times of 100 games of *Chutes and Ladders* (sometimes known as *Snakes and Ladders*) and want to use this data to perform a hypothesis test.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following pairs of hypotheses can we test using this data?

Option 1:
**Null Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average play time is 30 minutes.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average play time is not 30 minutes.

Option 2:
**Null Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average
play time is not 30 minutes.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the
average play time is 30 minutes

Option 3:
**Null Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders takes, on average, 30 minutes to play.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders does not take, on average, 30 minutes to play.

Option 4:
**Null Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders does not take, on average, 30 minutes to play.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders takes, on average, 30 minutes to play.

( ) Option 1
( ) Option 2
( ) Option 3
( ) Option 4

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 3

**Option 3:** is the correct answer because the Null Hypothesis can be applicable to the real world, and thus simulated, and has the test statistic “equal” to our prediction of 30 minutes. The Alternative Hypothesis is also correctly different from the Null Hypothesis by saying the test statistic is “not equal” to our prediction of 30 minutes.

**Option 1:** We want the Null Hypothesis or Alternative Hypothesis to be applicable to the real world, which means that by having the start “In a random sample…” we are discrediting this in the real world.

**Option 2:** Like Option 1, we want the Null Hypothesis or Alternative Hypothesis to be applicable to the real world, which means that by having the start “In a random sample…” we are discrediting this in the real world.

**Option 4:** This answer is wrong because the Null Hypothesis should be focused on figuring out the positive test statistic, in this case average. In other words, let `u` be the average time to play *Chutes and Ladders* and let `u<sub>0<\sub>` be 30 minutes. The Null Hypothesis should be `u` = `u<sub>0<\sub>` and the Alternative Hypothesis should be something different, in this case: `u` != `u<sub>0<\sub>`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
We use our collected data to construct a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the average play time of a game of *Chutes and Ladders*. This 95% confidence interval is [26.47, 28.47]. For the 100 games for which we collected data, what is the mean and standard deviation of the play times?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** mean = 27.47 and SD = 5

One of the key properties of the normal distribution is that about 95% of values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal, which means that to create this CLT-based 95% confidence interval, we used the 2 standard deviations rule.

What we're given, then, is the following:

$$\begin{align*} \text{Sample Mean} + 2 \cdot \text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= 28.47 \\ \text{Sample Mean} - 2 \cdot \text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= 26.47 \end{align*}$$

The sample mean is halfway between 26.47 and 28.47, which is 27.47. Substituting this into the first equation gives us

$$\begin{align*}27.47 + 2 \cdot \text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= 28.47\\2 \cdot \text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= 1 \\ \text{Distribution of Possible Sample Means} &= 0.5\end{align*}$$

It can be tempting to conclude that the sample standard deviation is 0.5, but it's not – the SD of the sample mean's distribution is 0.5. Remember, the SD of the sample mean's distribution is given by the square root law:

$$\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} = \frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} \approx \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}$$

We don't know the population SD, so we've used the sample SD as an estimate. As such, we have that 

$$\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} = 0.5 = \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}} = \frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{100}}$$

So, $\text{Sample SD} = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{100} = 0.5 \cdot 10 = 5$.

Does the CLT say that the distribution of play times of the 100 games is roughly
normal?

( ) Yes
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** No

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean or the sample sum is roughly normal. The distribution of play times is a sample of size 100 drawn from the population of play times; the Central Limit Theorem doesn't say anything about a population or any one sample.

Of the two hypotheses you selected in part (a), which one is better supported by the data?

( ) Null Hypothesis
( ) Alternative Hypothesis

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Alternative Hypothesis

To test the null hypothesis, we check whether 30 is in the confidence interval we constructed. 30 is not between 26.47 and 28.47, so we reject the null hypothesis that the average play time is 30 minutes.
