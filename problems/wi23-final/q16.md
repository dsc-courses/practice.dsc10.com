# BEGIN PROB
We collect data on the play times of 100 games of *Chutes and Ladders* (sometimes known as *Snakes and Ladders*) and want to use this data to perform a hypothesis test.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following pairs of hypotheses can we test using this data?

Option 1:
**Null Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average play time is 30 minutes.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average play time is not 30 minutes.

Option 2:
**Null Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the average
play time is not 30 minutes.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** In a random sample of Chutes and Ladders games, the
average play time is 30 minutes

Option 3:
**Null Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders takes, on average, 30 minutes to play.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders does not take, on average, 30 minutes to play.

Option 4:
**Null Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders does not take, on average, 30 minutes to play.
**Alternative Hypothesis:** A game of Chutes and Ladders takes, on average, 30 minutes to play.

( ) Option 1
( ) Option 2
( ) Option 3
( ) Option 4

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 3

**Option 3:** is the correct answer because the Null Hypothesis can be applicable to the real world, and thus simulated, and has the test statistic “equal” to our prediction of 30 minutes. The Alternative Hypothesis is also correctly different from the Null Hypothesis by saying the test statistic is “not equal” to our prediction of 30 minutes.

**Option 1:** We want the Null Hypothesis or Alternative Hypothesis to be applicable to the real world, which means that by having the start “In a random sample…” we are discrediting this in the real world.

**Option 2:** Like Option 1, we want the Null Hypothesis or Alternative Hypothesis to be applicable to the real world, which means that by having the start “In a random sample…” we are discrediting this in the real world.

**Option 4:** This answer is wrong because the Null Hypothesis should be focused on figuring out the positive test statistic, in this case average. In other words, let `u` be the average time to play *Chutes and Ladders* and let `u<sub>0<\sub>` be 30 minutes. The Null Hypothesis should be `u` = `u<sub>0<\sub>` and the Alternative Hypothesis should be something different, in this case: `u` != `u<sub>0<\sub>`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
We use our collected data to construct a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the average play time of a game of *Chutes and Ladders*. This 95% confidence interval is [26.47, 28.47]. For the 100 games for which we collected data, what is the mean and standard deviation of the play times?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** mean = 27.47 and SD = 5

We know from the Empirical Rule that 95% of the data of a normal distribution is between two standard deviations. We also know that the mean will be in the middle of the histogram. This means that to find the mean we do: $\frac{26.47 + 28.47}{2} = 27.47$. We can then find the standard deviation by doing: **How are they getting 5??? Why isn’t it: (28.47-27.77)/2, which is 0.5???**

<average>64</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Does the CLT say that the distribution of play times of the 100 games is roughly
normal?

( ) Yes
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** No

The Central Limit Theorem states that the probability distribution of the sum or average of a large random sample drawn with replacement will be roughly normal, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the sample was drawn.

The directions do not say anywhere that the games were a random sample, so we cannot assume that they were. The conditions to use CLT is: there is a large enough sample and the sample is random (with replacement).

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Of the two hypotheses you selected in part (a), which one is better supported by the data?

( ) Null Hypothesis
( ) Alternative Hypothesis

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Alternative Hypothesis

The average we found: 27.47, is different from 30, which we predicted. This means we are closer to the Alternative Hypothesis: A game of *Chutes and Ladders* does not take, on average, 30 minutes to play.
