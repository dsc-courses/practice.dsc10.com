The function `perm_test` should take three inputs:

1. `df`, a DataFrame.
2. `labels`, a string. The name of a column in df that contains two distinct values, which
signify the groups in a permutation test.
3. `data`, a string. The name of a column in df that contains numerical data.

The function should return an array of 1000 simulated differences of group means, under the assumption of the null hypothesis in a permutation test, namely that data in both groups come from the same population.

The smaller of the two group labels should be first in the subtraction. For example, if the
two values in the `labels` column are `"dice game"` and `"card game"`, we would compute the difference as the mean of the `"card game"` group minus the mean of the `"dice game"` group, because `"card game"` comes before `"dice game"` alphabetically. Note that **`groupby`** orders the rows in ascending order by default.

An incorrect implementation of `perm_test` is provided below.

```py
1 def perm_test(df, labels, data):
2   diffs = np.array([])
3   for i in np.arange(1000):
4       df.assign(shuffled=np.random permutation(df.get(data)))
5       means = df.groupby(labels).mean().get(data)
6       diff = means.iloc[0] - means.iloc[1]
7       diffs = np.append(diffs, diff)
8       return diffs
```
Three lines of code above are incorrect. Your job is to identify which lines of code are
incorrect, and describe briefly in English how you would fix them. You don’t need to explain
why the current code is wrong, just how to fix it.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
The first line that is incorrect is line number: _______

Explain in one sentence how to change this line. Do not write code.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Line 4; We need to save this as `df`.

Recall that `df.assign()` does not save the added column to the original `df`, which means that we need to save line 4 to a variable called `df`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
The second line that is incorrect is line number: _______

Explain in one sentence how to change this line. Do not write code.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Line 5; We need to get `"shuffled"` instead of `data`.

Recall a permutation test is simulating if samples come from the same population. This means we need to shuffle the data and use it to see if that would change our result/view. This means in line 5 we want to use the shuffled data, so we need to do `.get(“shuffled”)` instead of `.get(“data”)`. 

<average>50</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB
The third line that is incorrect is line number: _______

Explain in one sentence how to change this line. Do not write code.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Line 8; Move it outside of the `for`-loop (unindent).

If we have `return` inside of the `for`-loop it will terminate after it goes through the code once! This means all we have to do is unindent `return`, moving it outside of the `for`-loop.

<average>67</average>

Suppose you’ve fixed all the issues with this function, as you described above. Now, you want to use this corrected function to run a permutation test with the following hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis**: The play time of children’s dice-rolling games and the play time of children’s non-dice-rolling games come from the same distribution.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The play time of children’s dice-rolling games is lower, on average, than the play time of children’s non-dice-rolling games.

For this permutation test, consider a children’s game to be a game that has `"Children’s Games"` as part of the `"Domains"` column. A dice-rolling game is one that has `"Dice Rolling"` as part of the `"Mechanics"` column, and a non-dice-rolling game is one that does not have `"Dice Rolling"` as part of the `"Mechanics"` column.

The DataFrame `with_dice` is defined as follows.

```py
with_dice = games.assign(isDice = games.get("Mechanics").str.contains("Dice Rolling"))
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Write one line of code that creates an array called `simulated_diffs` containing 1000 simulated differences in group means for this permutation test. You should call your `perm_test` function here!

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

```py
simulated diffs = perm_test(with dice[with dice.get("Domains").str.contains("Children’s Games")], "isDice", "Play Time")
```

The inputs to `perm_test`, in order, are:

- A DataFrame containing all relevant information.
- The name of the column in that DataFrame that contains group labels.
- The name of the column in that DataFrame that contains numbers.

Here, the only relevant information is information on `"Children's Games"`, so the first argument to `perm_test` must be a DataFrame in which the `"Domains"` column contains `"Children's Games"`, as described in the question.

Then, since we're testing whether the distribution of `"Play Time"` is different for dice games and non-dice games, we know that the column with group labels is `"isDice"` (which is defined in the call to `.assign` that is provided to us in the question), and the column with numerical information is `"Play Time"`.

Suppose we’ve stored the observed value of the test statistic for this permutation test in the variable `obs_diff`. Fill in the blank below to find the p-value for this permutation test.

( ) <
( ) <=
( ) \>
( ) \>=

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** >= 

We want to find if the `simulated_diffs` are more or as extreme as the `obs_diff`. To be as or more extreme that means it needs an equal sign. The other part of this is it cannot be smaller because then it is **not** as extreme, which means the answer must be >=.
