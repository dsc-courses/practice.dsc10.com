As in the previous question, let `coop_sample` be a sample of 100 rows of games, all corresponding to cooperative games.

Define `samp` and `resamp` as follows.

```py
samp = coop_sample.get("Complexity")
resamp = coop_sample.sample(100, replace=True).get("Complexity")
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following statements **could** evaluate to True? Select all that are possible.

[ ] `len(samp.unique()) < len(resamp.unique())`
[ ] `len(samp.unique()) == len(resamp.unique())`
[ ] `len(samp.unique()) > len(resamp.unique())`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Options 2 and 3

**Option 2:** This is correct because it is possible for `resamp` to be shuffled in such a way that the number of unique elements are not the same.

**Option 3:** This is correct because it is possible for `resamp` to pull the same values more often making it less unique than `samp`.

**Option 1:** The reason that this is incorrect is because `samp.unique()` has the most possible unique elements inside of it. When we shuffle it using `coop_sample.sample(100, replace = True)` we could pull the same value multiple times, making it less unique.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following statements **could** evaluate to True? Select all that are possible.

[ ] `np.count nonzero(samp == 1) < np.count nonzero(resamp == 1)`
[ ] `np.count nonzero(samp == 1) == np.count nonzero(resamp == 1)`
[ ] `np.count nonzero(samp == 1) > np.count nonzero(resamp == 1)`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Options 1, 2, and 3

**Option 1:** It might be helpful to recall what exactly the column `“Complexity”` holds. In this case it holds the average complexity of the game on a scale of 1 to 5. The code is trying to find if the number of ones in `samp` and `resamp` are different. It is possible that when shuffling due to `replace = True` that `resamp` has more ones inside of it than `samp`.

**Option 2:** Once again it is possible that when shuffled `resamp` has the same number of ones as `samp` does.

**Option 3:** When we shuffle `coop_sample` there is no guarantee that one will sample more ones and instead other averages could be selected. This means it is possible for the number of ones in `samp` can be greater than the number of ones in `resamp`.

<average>83</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Which of the following statements **could** evaluate to True? Select all that are possible.

[ ] `samp.min() < resamp.min()`
[ ] `samp.min() == resamp.min()`
[ ] `samp.min() > resamp.min()`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Options 1 and 2 

**Option 1:** It is possible when shuffled that `samp`’s original minimum is never sampled, making `resamp`’s minimum to be greater than `samp`’s min.

**Option 2:**: If `samp`’s original min is sampled then it will be the same minimum that appears inside of `resamp`.

**Option 3:** It is impossible for `resamp`’s minimum to be less than `samp`’s minimum. This is because all of `resamp`’s values come from `samp`. That means there cannot be a smaller average inside of `resamp` that never appears in `samp`.

<average>83</average>

Which of the following statements **could** evaluate to True? Select all that are possible.

[ ] `np.std(samp) < np.std(resamp)`
[ ] `np.std(samp) == np.std(resamp)`
[ ] `np.std(samp) > np.std(resamp)`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Options 1, 2, and 3 

**Option 1:** `np.std()` gives us the standard deviation of the array we give it. When we do `np.std(samp)` we are finding the standard deviation of `“Complexity”`. When we do `np.std(resamp)` we are finding the standard deviation of `“Complexity”`, which may grab values multiple times. Since we are grabbing values multiple times it is possible to have a standard deviation become smaller if we continuously grab smaller values.

**Option 2:** If the `resamp` gets us the same values as `samp` we would end up with the same standard deviation, which would make `np.std(samp) == np.std(resamp)`.

**Option 3:** Similar to Option 1, we may grab many values which are on the larger end, which could increase our standard deviation.
