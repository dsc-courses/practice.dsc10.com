# BEGIN PROB

Choose the best tool to answer each of the following questions. Note the following:

- By “hypothesis testing,” we mean “standard” hypothesis testing, i.e. hypothesis testing
that **doesn’t** involve permutation testing or bootstrapping.
- By “bootstrapping,” we mean bootstrapping that **doesn’t** involve hypothesis testing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Are strategy games rated higher than non-strategy games?

( ) Hypothesis testing
( ) Permutation testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Permutation testing

Recall that we use a permutation test when we want to determine if two samples are from the same population. The question is asking if “strategy games” are rated higher than “non-strategy games” meaning we have two samples and want to know if they come from the same or different rating populations.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What is the mean complexity of all games?

( ) Hypothesis testing
( ) Permutation testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the act of resampling from a sample. We use bootstrapping because the original sample looks like the population, so by resampling the sample we are able to quantify our uncertainty. We can use bootstrapping to approximate the distribution of the sample statistic.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
 Are there an equal number of cooperative and non-cooperative games?

( ) Hypothesis testing
( ) Permutation testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Hypothesis Testing

Recall hypothesis tests quantify how “weird” a result is. We use it when we have a population distribution and one sample and we are trying to see if that sample was drawn from the population. In this instance we are trying to find if there are an equal number of cooperative and non-cooperative games. The population distribution is our DataFrame and we are trying to see if the cooperative games and non-cooperative games in our sample come from the same population.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Are games with more than one domain more complex than games with one domain?

( ) Hypothesis testing
( ) Permutation testing
( ) Bootstrapping

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Permutation testing

Once again we would use permutation testing to solve this problem because we have two samples: games with more than one domain and games with one domain. We do not know the population distribution.
