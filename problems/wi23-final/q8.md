Suppose that for children’s games, `"Play Time"` and `"Rating"` are negatively linearly associated due to children having short attention spans. Suppose that for children’s games, the
standard deviation of `"Play Time"` is twice the standard deviation of `"Rating"`, and the average `"Play Time"` is 10 minutes.
We use linear regression to predict the `"Rating"` of a children’s game based on its `"Play Time"`. The regression line predicts that *Don’t Break the Ice*, a children’s game with a `"Play Time"` of 8 minutes will have a `"Rating"` of 4. Which of the following could be the average `"Rating"` for children’s games?

( ) 2
( ) 2.8
( ) 3.1
( ) 4
