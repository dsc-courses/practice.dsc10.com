Suppose that for children’s games, `"Play Time"` and `"Rating"` are negatively linearly associated due to children having short attention spans. Suppose that for children’s games, the
standard deviation of `"Play Time"` is twice the standard deviation of `"Rating"`, and the average `"Play Time"` is 10 minutes.
We use linear regression to predict the `"Rating"` of a children’s game based on its `"Play Time"`. The regression line predicts that *Don’t Break the Ice*, a children’s game with a `"Play Time"` of 8 minutes will have a `"Rating"` of 4. Which of the following could be the average `"Rating"` for children’s games?

( ) 2
( ) 2.8
( ) 3.1
( ) 4

**Answer:** 3.1

Let's recall the formulas for the regression line in original units, since we're given information in original units in this question (such as the fact that for a `"Play Time"` of 8 **minutes**, the predicted `"Rating"` is 4 stars). Remember that throughout this question, `"Play Time"` is our $x$ and `"Rating"` is our $y$.

The regression line is of the form $y = mx + b$, where

$$m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x}, b = \text{mean of }y - m \cdot \text{mean of } x$$

There's a lot of information provided to us in the question – let's think about what it means in the context of our $x$s and $y$s.

- The first piece is that $r$ is negative, so $-1 \leq r < 0$.
- The second piece is that $\text{SD of } x = 2 \cdot (\text{SD of } y)$. Equivalently, we can say that $\frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of } x} = \frac{1}{2}$. This form is convenient, because it's close to the definition of the slope of the regression line, $m$. Using this fact, the slope of the regression line is $m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x} = r \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{r}{2}$.
- The $\text{mean of } x$ is 10. This means that the intercept of the regression line, $b$, is $b = \text{mean of }y - m \cdot \text{mean of } x = \text{mean of }y - \frac{r}{2} \cdot 10 = \text{mean of }y - 5r$.
- If $x$ is 8, the predicted $y$ is 4.

Given all of this information, we need to find possible values for the $\text{mean of } y$. Substituting our known values for $m$ and $b$ into $y = mx + b$ gives us

$$y = \frac{r}{2} x + \text{mean of }y - 5r$$

Now, using the fact that if if $x = 8$, the predicted $y$ is 4, we have

$$\begin{align*}4 &= \frac{r}{2} \cdot 8 + \text{mean of }y - 5r\\4 &= 4r - 5r + \text{mean of }y\\ 4 + r &= \text{mean of} y\end{align*}$$

Cool! We now know that the $\text{mean of } y$ is $4 + r$. We know that $r$ must satisfy the relationship $-1 \leq r < 0$. By adding 4 to all pieces of this inequality, we have that $3 \leq r + 4 < 4$, which means that $3 \leq \text{mean of } y < 4$. Of the four options provided, only one is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 4, which is 3.1.
