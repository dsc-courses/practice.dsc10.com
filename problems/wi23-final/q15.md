# BEGIN PROB
At a recent game night, you played several new board games and liked them so much that you now want to buy copies for yourself.

The DataFrame `stores` is shown below in full. Each row represents a game you want to buy and a local board game store where that game is available for purchase. If a game is not available at a certain store, there will be no row corresponding to that store and that game.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
The DataFrame `prices` has five rows. Below we merge `stores` with `prices` and display the output in full.

```py
merged = stores.merge(prices, on="Game")
merged
```

<br>

In the space below, specify what the DataFrame `prices` **could** look like. The column
labels should go in the top row, and the row labels (index) should go in the leftmost row. You may not need to use all the columns provided, but you are told that `prices` has five rows, so you should use all rows provided.

**Note:** There are several correct answers to this question.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

<center><img src='../assets/images/wi23-final/filled_prices.jpg' width=40%></center>

We can use the `merged` DataFrame to figure out the prices that correlate to each game in `stores`. We see in `merged` the price for *Tickets to Ride* should be 47.99, so we create a row for that game. We repeat this process to find the remaining rows. Since we know that `prices` have 5 rows we then make a game and price up. Note that in the solution above the last row (index 4) has `“Sushi Go”` and `9.99`. These can be any game or any price that is not listed in indexes 0 to 4. This is because `prices` has 5 rows and when we use `.merge()` since the game `“Sushi Go”` is not in `stores` it will not be added.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Suppose `merged` now contains all the available games and their corresponding prices at each store (in particular, a given game is sold for the same price at all stores). You want to buy as many games as possible but you only want to go to one store. Which store should you go to maximize the number of games you can buy?

Fill in the blanks so that `where_to_go` evaluates to the name of the store you should buy your games from.

```py
where_to_go = (merged.groupby("Store").__(a)__.sort_values(by="Price", ascending=False).__(b)__)
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (a)?

( ) min()
( ) max()
( ) count()
( ) mean()

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `count()`

The problem asks us which store would allow us to buy as many games as possible. The provided code is `merge.groupby(“Store”).__a__`. We want to use the aggregate method that allows us to find the number of games in each store. The aggregation method for this would be `count()`.

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (b)?


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `index[0]`

Recall `groupby()` will cause the unique values from the column `“Store”` to be in the index. The remaining part of the code sorts the DataFrame so that the store with the most games is at the top. This means the row at index 0 has the store and most number of games inside of the DataFrame. To grab the element at the 1st index we simply do `index[0]`.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Suppose you go to the store `where_to_go` and buy one copy of each of the available games that you enjoyed at game night. How much money will you spend? Write **one line of code** that evaluates to the answer, using the `merged` DataFrame and no others.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `merged[merged.get(“Store”) == where_to_go].get(“Price”).sum()`

We want to figure out how much money we would spend if we went to `where_to_go`, which is the store where we can buy as many games as possible. We can simply query the merged DataFrame to only contain the rows where the store is equal to `where_to_go`. We then can simply get the `“Price”` column and add all of the values up by doing `.sum()` on the Series.
