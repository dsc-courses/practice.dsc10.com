# BEGIN PROB
We use the regression line to predict a gameâ€™s `"Rating"` based on its `"Complexity"`. We find that for the game *Wingspan*, which has a `"Complexity"` that is 2 points higher than the average, the predicted `"Rating"` is 3 points higher than the average.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What can you conclude about the correlation coefficient r?

( ) *r* < 0
( ) *r* = 0
( ) *r* > 0
( ) We cannot make any conclusions about the value of *r* based on this information alone.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** *r* > 0

Recall *r* represents the relationship between x and y. We know if when x increases it is associated with a higher y then `r` must be positive. We know from the information given to us `"Rating"` is 3 points higher than average and `"Complexity"` is 2 points higher than average. This means that, because this is a prediction line, `"Rating"` and `"Complexity"` is correlated to each other.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What can you conclude about the standard deviations of "Complexity" and "Rating"?

( ) SD of `"Complexity"` < SD of `"Rating"`
( ) SD of `"Complexity"` = SD of `"Rating"`
( ) SD of `"Complexity"` > SD of `"Rating"`
( ) We cannot make any conclusions about the relationship between these two standard deviations based on this information alone.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** SD of `"Complexity"` < SD of `"Rating"`

Increasing in `"Rating"` is greater than the increase in `"Complexity"`.

We can imagine if two elements were correlated AND they had the same standard deviations then if one goes up by 1 unit the other will too. Similarily, if one goes up by 1 unit, but the other goes up by 2 units then the correlation is not perfect. In this case we would expect `"Complexity"` to increase slower than `"Rating"` because the column `"Rating"` has a greater standard deviation.
