# BEGIN PROB
We use the regression line to predict a gameâ€™s `"Rating"` based on its `"Complexity"`. We find that for the game *Wingspan*, which has a `"Complexity"` that is 2 points higher than the average, the predicted `"Rating"` is 3 points higher than the average.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What can you conclude about the correlation coefficient r?

( ) *r* < 0
( ) *r* = 0
( ) *r* > 0
( ) We cannot make any conclusions about the value of *r* based on this information alone.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** *r* > 0

**NOT DONE**

<average>74</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What can you conclude about the standard deviations of "Complexity" and "Rating"?

( ) SD of `"Complexity"` < SD of `"Rating"`
( ) SD of `"Complexity"` = SD of `"Rating"`
( ) SD of `"Complexity"` > SD of `"Rating"`
( ) We cannot make any conclusions about the relationship between these two standard deviations based on this information alone.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** SD of `"Complexity"` < SD of `"Rating"`

**NOT DONE**

<average>42</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
