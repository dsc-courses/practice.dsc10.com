# BEGIN PROB
Dylan, Harshi, and Selim are playing a variant of a dice game called *Left, Center, Right* (*LCR*) in which there are 9 chips (tokens) and 9 dice. Each player starts off with 3 chips. Each die has the following six sides: L, C, R, Dot, Dot, Dot.

During a given player’s turn, they must roll a number of dice equal to the number of chips they currently have. Each die determines what to do with one chip:

1. L means give the chip to the player on their left.
2. R means give the chip to the player on their right.
3. C means put the chip in the center of the table. This chip is now out of play.
4. Dot means do nothing (or keep the chip).

Since the number of dice rolled is the same as the number of chips the player has, the dice rolls determine exactly what to do with each chip. There is no strategy at all in this simple game.

Dylan will take his turn first (we’ll call him Player 0), then at the end of his turn, he’ll pass the dice to his left and play will continue clockwise around the table. Harshi (Player 1) will go next, then Selim (Player 2), then back to Dylan, and so on.

Note that if someone has no chips when it’s their turn, they are still in the game and they still take their turn, they just roll 0 dice because they have 0 chips. The game ends when only one person is holding chips, and that person is the winner. If 300 turns have been taken (100 turns each), the game will end and we’ll declare it a tie.

The function `simulate_lcr` below simulates one full game of *Left, Center, Right* and returns the number of turns taken in that game. Some parts of the code are not provided. You will need to fill in the code for the parts marked with a blank. The parts marked with `...` are not provided, but you don’t need to fill them in because they are very similar to other parts that you do need to complete.

**Hint:** Recall that in Python, the % operator gives the remainder upon division. For example 12 % 5 is 2.

```py
def simulate_lcr():
    # stores the number of chips for players 0, 1, 2 (in that order)
    player_chips = np.array([3,3,3])

    # maximum of 300 turns allotted for the game
    for i in np.arange(300):

        # which player's turn it is currently (0, 1, or 2)
        current_player = __(a)__

        # stores what the player rolled on their turn
        roll = np.random.choice(["L", "C", "R", "Dot", "Dot", "Dot"], __(b)__)

        # count the number of instances of L, C, and R
        L_count = __(c)__
        C_count = ...
        R_count = ...

        if current_player == 0:
            # update player_chips based on what player 0 rolled
            player_chips = player_chips + np.array(__(d)__)
        elif current_player == 1:
            # update player_chips based on what player 1 rolled
            player_chips = player_chips + ...
        else:
            # update player_chips based on what player 2 rolled
            player_chips = player_chips + ...

        # if the game is over, return the number of turns played
        if __(e)__:
            return __(f)__

    # if no one wins after 300 turns, return 300
    return 300
```

What goes in blank (a)?



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `i % 3` 

We are trying to find which player’s turn it is within the `for`-loop. We know that each player: Dylan, Harshi, and Selim will play a maximum of 100 turns. Notice that the `for`-loop goes from 0 to 299. This means we need to manipulate the `i` somehow to figure out whose turn it is. The hint here is extremely helpful. The maximum remainder we want to have is 2 (recall the players are called Player 0, Player 1, and Player 2). This means we can utilize `%` to give us the remainder of `i / 3`, which would tell us which player’s turn it is.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `player_chips[current_player]`

Recall `np.random.choice()` must be given an array and can then optionally be given a `size` to get multiple values instead of one. We know that `player_chips` is an array of the chips for each player. To access a specific player’s chips we can use `[current_player]` because the 1st index of `player_chips` corresponds to Player 0, the 2nd index corresponds to Player 1, and the 3rd index corresponds to Player 2.

What goes in blank (c)?



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `np.count_nonzero(roll == “L”)

We know that if we do `roll == “L”` then we get an array which changes the index of each element in `roll` to `True` if that element equals `“L”` and `False` otherwise. We can then use `np.count_nonzero()` to count the number of `True` values there are.

What goes in blank (d)?



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `[-(L_count + C_count + R_count), L_count, R_count]`

Recall the rules of the games:

1. L means give the chip to the player on their left.
2. R means give the chip to the player on their right.
3. C means put the chip in the center of the table. This chip is now out of play.
4. Dot means do nothing (or keep the chip)

If we are Player 0 the person to our left is Player 1 and the person to our right is Player 2. We want to update `player_chips` to appropriately give the players to our left and right chips. This means we can add our own array with the element at index 1 be our `L_count` and the element at index 2 be our `R_count`. We need to also subtract the tokens we are giving away and `C_count`, so in index 0 we have: `-(L_count + C_count + R_count)`.

What goes in blank (e)?



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `np.count_nonzero(player_chips) == 1`

We want to stop the game early if only one person has chips. To do this we can use `np.count_nonzero(player_chips)` to count the number of elements inside `player_chips` that have chips. If the player does not have chips then their index would have 0 inside of it.

What goes in blank (f)?



# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `i + 1`

To find the number of  turns played we simply need to add 1 to `i`. We do this because `i` starts at 0!
