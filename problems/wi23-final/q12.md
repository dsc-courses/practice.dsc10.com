In the game *Spot It*, players race to identify an object that appears on two different cards. Each card contains images of eight objects, and exactly one object is common to both cards.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Suppose the objects appearing on each card are stored in an array, and our task is to find the object that appears on both cards. Complete the function `find_match` that takes as input two arrays of 8 objects each, with one object in common, and returns the name of the object in both arrays.

For example, suppose we have two arrays defined as follows.

```py
objects1 = np.array(["dragon", "spider", "car", "water droplet", "spiderweb", "candle", "ice cube", "ladybug"])
objects2 = np.array(["zebra", "lock", "dinosaur", "eye", "fire", "shamrock", "spider", "carrot"])
```

Then `find_match(objects1, objects2)` should evaluate to `"spider"`.
Your function must include a for loop, and it must take **at most three lines of code** (not counting the line with `def`).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

```py
def find_match(array1, array2):
    for obj in array1:
        if obj in array2:
            return obj
```

We first need to define the function `find_match()`. We can gather since we are feeding in two groups of objects we are giving `find_match()` two parameters, which we have called `array1` and `array2`. The next step is utilizing a `for`-loop. We want to look at all the objects inside of `array1` and then check using an `if`-statement if that object exists in `array2`. If it does, we can stop the loop and `return` the object!

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Now suppose the objects appearing on each card are stored in a DataFrame with 8 rows and one column called `"object"`. Complete the function `find_match_again` that takes as input two such DataFrames with one object in common and returns the nameof the object in both DataFrames.

Your function may not call the previous function `find_match`, and it must take exactly **one line of code** (not counting the line with `def`).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

```py
def find_match_again(df1, df2)
	return df1.merge(df2, on = “object”).get(“object”).iloc[0]
```
Once again we need to define our function and then have two parameters for the two DataFrames. Recall the method `.merge()` which will combine two DataFrames and only give us the elements that are shared. The directions tell us that both DataFrames have a single column called `“object”`. Since we want to combine the DataFrames on that column we do have: `df1.merge(df2, on = “object”)`. Once we have merged the DataFrames we should have only 1 row with the index and the column `“object”`. To isolate the element inside of this DataFrame we can first get a Series by doing `.get(“object”)` and then do `.iloc[0]` to get the element inside of the Series.
