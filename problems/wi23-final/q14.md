Suppose the function `simulate_lcr` from the last question has been correctly implemented, and we want to use it to see how many turns a game of *Left, Center, Right* usually takes.

**Note:** You can answer this question even if you couldnâ€™t answer the previous one.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Consider the code and histogram below.

```py
turns = np.array([])
for i in np.arange(10000):
    turns = np.append(turns, simulate_lcr())
(bpd.DataFrame().assign(turns=turns).plot(kind="hist", density = True, ec="w", bins = np.arange(0, 66, 6)))
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Does this histogram show a probability distribution or an empirical distribution?

( ) Probability Distribution
( ) Empirical Distribution

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Empirical Distribution

An index should be unique. In this case `'Name'`, `'Date'`, `'Time'`, and `'Latitude'` have repetative values, which does **not** make them unique. Remember `'Name'` will be reused every six years, multiple hurricanes could happen on the same date, time, or latitude.

<average>54</average>

What is the probability of a game of *Left, Center, Right* lasting 30 turns or more?

Suppose a player with *n* chips takes their turn. What is the probability that they will have to put at least one chip into the center? Give your answer as a mathematical expression involving *n*.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $1 - (\frac{5}{6})<sup>n</sup>$

Recall that the die used to play this game has six sides: L, C, R, Dot, Dot, Dot. The chance of getting C is $\frac{1}{6}$. So we can take the compliment of that to get $\frac{5}{6}$, which is the probability of not putting at least one chip into the center and then doing ($\frac{5}{6}$)<sup>n</sup>. Once again we must use the complement rule as to convert it back to the probability of putting at least one chip into the center. This gives us the answer: $1 - (\frac{5}{6})<sup>n</sup>$

<average>56</average>
