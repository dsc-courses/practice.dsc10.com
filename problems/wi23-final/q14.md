Suppose the function `simulate_lcr` from the last question has been correctly implemented, and we want to use it to see how many turns a game of *Left, Center, Right* usually takes.

**Note:** You can answer this question even if you couldn’t answer the previous one.

Consider the code and histogram below.

```py
turns = np.array([])
for i in np.arange(10000):
    turns = np.append(turns, simulate_lcr())
(bpd.DataFrame().assign(turns=turns).plot(kind="hist", density = True, ec="w", bins = np.arange(0, 66, 6)))
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Does this histogram show a probability distribution or an empirical distribution?

( ) Probability Distribution
( ) Empirical Distribution

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Empirical Distribution

An empirical distribution is derived from observed data, in this case, the results of 10,000 simulated games of Left, Center, Right. It represents the frequencies of outcomes (number of turns taken in each game) as observed in these simulations.

What is the probability of a game of *Left, Center, Right* lasting 30 turns or more?
Choose the closest answer below.

( ) 0.01
( ) 0.06
( ) 0.10
( ) 0.60

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.06

We're being asked to find the proportion of values in the histogram that are greater than or equal to 30, which is equal to the area of the histogram to the right of 30. Immediately, we can rule out 0.01 and 0.60, because the area to the right of 30 is more than 1% of the total area and less than 60% of the total area.

The problem then boils down to determining whether the area to the right of 30 is 0.06 or 0.10. While you could solve this by finding the areas of the three bars individually and adding them together, there's a quicker solution. Notice that the $x$-axis gridlines – the vertical lines in the background in white – appear every 10 units (at $x = 0$, $x = 10$, $x = 20$, $x = 30$, and so on) and the $y$-axis gridlines – the horizontal lines in the background in white – appear every 0.01 units (at $y = 0$, $y = 0.01$, $y = 0.02$, and so on). There's a "box" in the grid between $x = 30$ and $x = 40$, and between $y = 0$ and $y = 0.01$. The area of that box is $(40 - 30) \cdot 0.01 = 0.1$, which means that if a bar book up the entire box, then 10% of the values in this distribution would fall into that bar's bin.

So, to decide whether the area to the right of 30 is closer to 0.06 or 0.1, we can estimate whether the three bars to the right of 30 would fill up the entire box described above (that is, the box from 30 to 40 on the $x$-axis and 0 to 0.1 on the $y$-axis), or whether it would be much emptier. Visually, if you broke off the area that is to the right of 40 in the histogram and put it in the box we've just described, then quite a bit of the box would still be empty. As such, the area to the right of 30 is less than the area of the box, so it's less than 0.1, and so the only valid option is 0.06.

Suppose a player with $n$ chips takes their turn. What is the probability that they will have to put at least one chip into the center? Give your answer as a mathematical expression involving $n$.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $1 - (\frac{5}{6})^n$

Recall that the die used to play this game has six sides: L, C, R, Dot, Dot, Dot. The chance of getting C is $\frac{1}{6}$. So we can take the compliment of that to get $\frac{5}{6}$, which is the probability of not putting at least one chip into the center and then doing ($\frac{5}{6}$)^n. Once again we must use the complement rule as to convert it back to the probability of putting at least one chip into the center. This gives us the answer: $1 - (\frac{5}{6})$^n

Suppose a player with $n$ chips takes their turn. What is the probability that they will end their turn with $n$ chips? Give your answer as a mathematical expression involving
$n$.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n$

Recall, when it is a player's turn, they roll one die for each of the $n$ chips they have. The die that they roll has six faces. In three of those faces (L, C, and R), they end up losing a chip, and in the other three of those faces (dot, dot, and dot), they keep the chip. So, for each chip, there is a $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ chance that they get to keep it after the turn. Since each die roll is independent, there is a $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n$ chance that they get to keep all $n$ chips. (Note that there is no way to earn more chips during a turn, so that's not something we need to consider.)
