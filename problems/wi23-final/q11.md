In recent years, there has been an explosion of board games that teach computer programming skills, including *CoderMindz*, *Robot Turtles*, and *Code Monkey Island*. Many such games were made possible by Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns.

Suppose that in one such game, players must prove their understanding of functions and conditional statements by answering questions about the function `wham`, defined below. Like players of this game, youâ€™ll also need to answer questions about this function.

```py
1 def wham(a, b):
2   if a < b:
3       return a + 2
4   if a + 2 == b:
5       print(a + 3)
6       return b + 1
7   elif a - 1 > b:
8       print(a)
9       return a + 2
10  else:
11      return a + 1
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What is printed when we run `print(wham(6, 4))`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 6 8

When we call `wham(6, 4)`, `a` gets assigned to the number 6 and `b` gets assigned to the number 4. In the function we look at the first `if`-statement. The `if`-statement is checking if `a`, 6, is less than `b`, 4. We know 6 is not less than 4, so we skip this section of code. Next we see the second `if`-statement which checks if `a`, 6, plus 2 equals `b`, 4. We know $6 + 2 = 8$, which is not equal to 4. We then look at the `elif`-statement which asks if `a`, 6, minus 1 is greater than `b`, 4. This is True! $6 - 1 = 5$ and 5 > 4. So we `print(a)`, which will spit out 6 and then we will `return a + 2`. `a + 2` is $6 + 2$. This means the function `wham` will print 6 and return 8.

Give an example of a pair of integers `a` and `b` such that `wham(a, b)` returns `a + 1`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Any pair of integers `a`, `b` with `a = b` or with `a = b + 1`

The desired output is `a + 1`. So we want to look at the function `wham` and see which condition is necessary to get the output `a + 1`. It turns out that this can be found in the `else`-block, which means we need to find an `a` and `b` that will not satisfy any of the `if` or `elif`-statements.

If `a = b`, so for example `a` points to 4 and `b` points to 4 then: `a` is not less than `b` (4 < 4), `a + 2` is not equal to `b` ($4 + 2 = 6$ and 6 does not equal 4), and `a - 1` is not greater than `b` ($4 - 1= 3$) and 3 is not greater than 4.

If `a = b + 1` this means that `a` is greater than `b`, so for example if `b` is 4 then `a` is 5 ($4 + 1 = 5$). If we look at the `if`-statements then `a < b` is not true (5  is greater than 4), `a + 2 == b` is also not true ($5 + 2 = 7$ and 7 does not equal 4), and `a - 1 > b` is also not true ($5 - 1 = 4$ and 4 is equal not greater than 4). This means it will trigger the `else` statement.

Which of the following lines of code will never be executed, for any input?

( ) 3
( ) 6
( ) 9
( ) 11

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 6

For this to happen: `a + 2 == b` then `a` must be less than `b` by 2. However if `a` is less than `b` it will trigger the first `if`-statement. This means this second `if`-statement will never run, which means that the `return` on line 6 never happens.
