The following is a quote from The New York Times' *The Morning* newsletter.

<i>As Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me this weekend: “I don’t actually care about infections. I care about hospitalizations and deaths and long-term complications.” </i>

<i>By those measures, all five of the vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson — look extremely good. Of the roughly 75,000 people who have received one of the five in a research trial, not a single person has died from Covid, and only a few people appear to have been hospitalized. None have remained hospitalized 28 days after receiving a shot.</i>

<i>To put that in perspective, it helps to think about what Covid has done so far to **a representative group of 75,000 American adults**: It has killed roughly 150 of them and sent several hundred more to the hospital. The vaccines reduce those numbers to zero and nearly zero, based on the research trials.</i>

<i>Zero isn’t even the most relevant benchmark. A typical U.S. flu season kills between five and 15 out of every 75,000 adults and hospitalizes more than 100 of them.</i>

Why does the article use a representative group of 75,000 American adults?

( ) Convention. Rates are often given per 75,000 people.
( ) Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.
( ) Comprehension. Readers should have a sense of the scale of 75,000 people.
( ) Arbitrary. There is no particular reason to use a group of this size.

**Answer: ** Comparison. It allows for quick comparison against the group of people who got the vaccine in a trial.

The purpose of the article is to compare Covid outcomes among two groups of people: the 75,000 people who got the vaccine in a research trial and a representative group of 75,000 American adults. Since 75,000 people got the vaccine in a research trial, we need to compare statistics like number of deaths and hospitalizations to another group of the same size for the comparison to be meaningful. 

There is no convention about using 75,000 for rates. This number is used because that's how many people got the vaccine in a research trial. If a different number of people had been vaccinated in a research trial, the article would have taken that number of adults in their representative comparison group.

75,000 is quite a large number and most people probably don't have a sense of the scale of 75,000 people. If the goal were comprehension, it would have made more sense to use a smaller number like 100 people.

The number 75,000 is not arbitrary. It was chosen as the size of the representative group specifically to equal the number of people who got the vaccine in a research trial.
