Which of the following questions could not be answered by running a randomized controlled experiment?

( ) Does eating citrus fruits increase the risk of heart disease?
( ) Do exams with integrity pledges have fewer reported cases of academic dishonesty?
( ) Does rewarding students for good grades improve high school graduation rates?
( ) Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life span?

**Answer: ** Does drug abuse lead to a shorter life span?

It would be unethical to try to run a randomized controlled experiment to address the question of whether drug abuse leads to a shorter life span, as this would involve splitting participants into groups and telling one group to abuse drugs. This is problematic because we know drug abuse brings about a host of problems, so we could not ethically ask people to harm themselves.

Notice that the first proposed study, about the impacts of citrus fruits on heart disease, does not involve the same kind of ethical dilemma because we're not forcing people to do something known to be harmful. A randomized controlled experiment would involve splitting participants into two groups and asking one group to eat citrus fruits, and measuring the heart health of both groups. Since there are no known harmful effects of eating citrus fruits, there is no ethical issue. 

Similarly, we could run a randomized controlled trial by giving an exam where some students had to sign an integrity pledge and others didn't, tracking the number of reported dishonesty cases in each group. Likewise, we could reward some students for good grades and not others, and keep track of high school graduation rates in each group. Neither of these studies would involve knowingly harming people and could reasonably be carried out.
