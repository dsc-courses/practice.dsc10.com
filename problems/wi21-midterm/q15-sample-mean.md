Suppose we take a uniform random sample with replacement from a population, and use the sample mean as an estimate for the population mean. Which of the following is correct?

( ) If we take a larger sample, our sample mean will be closer to the population mean.
( ) If we take a smaller sample, our sample mean will be closer to the population mean.
( ) If we take a larger sample, our sample mean is more likely to be close to the population mean than if we take a smaller sample.
( ) If we take a smaller sample, our sample mean is more likely to be close to the population mean than if we take a larger sample.

**Answer: ** If we take a larger sample, our sample mean is more likely to be close to the population mean than if we take a smaller sample.

Larger samples tend to give better estimates of the population mean than smaller samples. That's because large samples are more like the population than small samples. We can see this in the extreme. Imagine a sample of 1 element from a population. The sample might vary a lot, depending on the distribution of the population. On the other extreme, if we sample the whole population, our sample mean will be exactly the same as the population mean.

Notice that the correct answer choice uses the words "is more likely to be close to" as opposed to "will be closer to." We're talking about a general phenomenon here: larger samples tend to give better estimates of the population mean than smaller samples. We cannot say that if we take a larger sample our sample mean "will be closer to" the population mean, since it's always possible to get lucky with a small sample and unlucky with a large sample. That is, one particular small sample may happen to have a mean very close to the population mean, and one particular large sample may happen to have a mean that's not so close to the population mean. This *can* happen, it's just not likely to.
