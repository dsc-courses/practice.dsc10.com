# BEGIN PROB

Describe in your own words the difference between a probability distribution and an empirical distribution. Give an example of what each distribution might look like for a certain experiment. Choose an experiment that we have not already seen in this class.

**Answer: ** There are many possible correct answers. Below are some student responses that earned full credit, lightly edited for clarity.

<i>Probability distributions are theoretical distributions distributed over all possible values of an experiment. Meanwhile, empirical distributions are distributions of the real observed data. An example of this would be choosing a certain suit from a deck of cards. The probability distribution would be uniform, with a 1/4 chance of choosing each suit. Meanwhile, the empirical distribution of choosing suits from a deck of cards in 50 pulls manually and graphing the observed data would show us different chances. </i>

<i>A probability distribution is the distribution describing the theoretical probability of each potential value occurring in an experiment, while the empirical distribution describes the proportion of each of the values in the experiment after running it, including all observed values. In other words, the probability distribution is what we expect to happen, and the empirical distribution is what actually happens.</i>

<i>For example: My friends and I often go to a food court to eat, and we randomly pick a restaurant every time. There is 1 McDonald's, 1 Subway, and 2 Panda Express restaurants in the food court.</i>

<i>The probability distribution is as follows:

- P(McDonald's) = 0.25
- P(Subway) = 0.25
- P(Panda Express) = 0.5

<i>After going to the food court 100 times, we look at the empirical distribution to see which restaurants we eat at most often. it is as follows:</i>

- (McDonald's) = 0.21
- (Subway) = 0.22
- (Panda Express) = 0.57</i>

<i>Probability distribution is a theoretical representation of certain outcomes in an event whereas an empirical distribution is the observational representation of the same outcomes in an event produced from an experiment.</i>

<i>An example would be if I had 10 pairs of shoes in my closet: 
The probability distribution would suggest that each pair of shoes has an equal chance of getting picked on any given day.
On the other hand, an empirical distribution would be drawn by recording which pair got picked on a given day in N trials. </i>
