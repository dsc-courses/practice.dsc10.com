# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we run the following code to simulate the winners of the Tour de France.

```py
    evenepoel_wins = 0
    vingegaard_wins = 0
    pogacar_wins = 0
    for i in np.arange(4):
        result = np.random.multinomial(1, [0.3, 0.3, 0.4])
        if result[0] == 1:
            evenepoel_wins = evenepoel_wins + 1
        elif result[1] == 1:
            vingegaard_wins = vingegaard_wins + 1
        elif result[2] == 1:
            pogacar_wins = pogacar_wins + 1
```
