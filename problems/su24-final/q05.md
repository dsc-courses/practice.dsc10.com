# BEGIN PROB

In this question, suppose `random_stages` is a random sample of undetermined size drawn with replacement from `stages`. We want to estimate the proportion of stage wins won by each country.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we extract the winning countries and store the resulting Series.
Consider the variable `winners` defined below, which you may use
throughout this question:

```py
winners = random_stages.get("Winner Country")
```

Write a single line of code that evaluates to the proportion of stages in `random_stages` won by France (country code `"FRA"`).


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `np.mean(winners == "FRA")` or `np.count_nonzero(winners == "FRA") / len(winners)`

`winners == "FRA"` creates a Boolean array where each element is True if the corresponding value in the winners Series equals `"FRA"`, and False otherwise.
In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0 when used in numerical operations.
`np.mean(winners == "FRA")` computes the average of this Boolean array, which is equivalent to the proportion of True values (i.e., the proportion of stages won by `"FRA"`).

Alternatively, you can use `np.count_nonzero(winners == "FRA") / len(winners)`, which counts the number of `True` values and divides by the total number of entries to compute the proportion.

We want to generate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of wins by France in `stages` by using our random sample `random_stages`. How many rows need to be in `random_stages` for our confidence interval to have width of at most 0.03? Recall that the maximum standard deviation for any series of zeros and ones is 0.5. Do not simplify your answer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $4 * \frac{0.5}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 0.03$

For a 95% confidence interval for the population mean:
$$
\left[
\text{sample mean} - 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}, \
\text{sample mean} + 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
\right]
$$

Note that the width of our CI is the right endpoint minus the left endpoint:

$$
\text{width} = 4 \cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
$$

Substitute the **maximum standard deviation** (sample SD = 0.5) for any series of zeros and ones and set the width to be at most **0.03**:
$$
4 \cdot \frac{0.5}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 0.03.
$$

Suppose we now want to test the hypothesis that the true proportion of stages won by Italy (`"ITA"`) is $0.2$ using a confidence interval and the Central Limit Theorem. We want to conduct our hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.01. Fill in the blanks to construct the confidence interval `[interval_left, interval_right]`. Your answer must use the Central Limit Theorem, not bootstrapping. Assume an integer variable `sample_size = len(winners)` has been defined, regardless of your answer to part 2.

Hint: 
```py
stats.norm.cdf(2.576) - stats.norm.cdf(-2.576) = 0.99
```

```py
    interval_center = __(i)__
    mystery = __(ii)__ * np.std(__(iii)__ ) / __(iv)__
    interval_left = interval_center - mystery
    interval_right = interval_center + mystery
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

The confidence interval for the true proportion is given by:
$$
\left[
\text{sample mean} - z\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}, \
\text{sample mean} + z\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
\right]
$$

- **(i):** `np.mean(winners == "ITA")` or `(winners == "ITA").mean()`  
   - The center of the confidence interval is the **sample mean proportion** of stages won by Italy. This is calculated by taking the mean of the Boolean array where `winners` equals `"ITA"`. The Boolean array has values `1` (if true) or `0` (if false), so the mean directly represents the proportion.

- **(ii):** `2.576`  
   - This is the **critical value** corresponding to a 99% confidence level. 
   To have 99% of the data between $-z$ and $z$, the area under the curve outside of this range is: 1 - 0.99 = 0.01, split equally between the two tails (0.005 in each tail). This means: $P(-z \leq Z \leq z) = 0.99$.

    - The CDF at $z = 2.576$ captures 99.5% of the area to the left of 2.576: $\text{stats.norm.cdf}(2.576) \approx 0.995$.

    - Similarly, the CDF at $z = -2.576$ captures 0.5% of the area to the left: $\text{stats.norm.cdf}(-2.576) \approx 0.005$.

    - The total area between $-2.576$ and $2.576$ is:
    $$
    \text{stats.norm.cdf}(2.576) - \text{stats.norm.cdf}(-2.576) = 0.995 - 0.005 = 0.99.
    $$

      This confirms that $z = 2.576$ is the correct critical value for a 99% confidence level.

- **(iii):** `winners == "ITA"`  
   - The **standard deviation** is calculated using the Boolean array where `winners` equals `"ITA"`.

- **(iv):** `np.sqrt(sample_size)`  
   - The denominator is the square root of the sample size. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem.

What is our null hypothesis?

( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is not 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is greater than 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is less than 0.2.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**  The true proportion of stages won by Italy is 0.2.

The null hypothesis assumes that there is no difference or effect. Here, it states that the true proportion of stages won by Italy equals 0.2.

What is our alternative hypothesis?

( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is not 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is greater than 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is less than 0.2.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** The true proportion of stages won by Italy is not 0.2.

The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. Here, we test whether the true proportion of stages won by Italy is **different** from 0.2.

Suppose we calculated the interval $[0.195, 0.253]$ using the above process. Should we reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis?

( ) Reject 
( ) Fail to reject

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Fail to reject.

The confidence interval calculated is `[0.195, 0.253]`, and the null hypothesis value (0.2) lies within this interval. This means that 0.2 is a plausible value for the true proportion at the 99% confidence level. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
