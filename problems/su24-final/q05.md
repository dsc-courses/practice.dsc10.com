# BEGIN PROB

In this question, suppose `random_stages` is a random sample of undetermined size drawn with replacement from `stages`. We want to estimate the proportion of stage wins won by each country.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we extract the winning countries and store the resulting Series.
Consider the variable `winners` defined below, which you may use
throughout this question:

```py
winners = random_stages.get("Winner Country")
```

Write a single line of code that evaluates to the proportion of stages in `random_stages` won by France (country code `"FRA"`).


# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

We want to generate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of wins by France in `stages` by using our random sample `random_stages`. How many rows need to be in `random_stages` for our confidence interval to have width of at most 0.03? Recall that the maximum standard deviation for any series of zeros and ones is 0.5. Do not simplify your answer.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we now want to test the hypothesis that the true proportion of stages won by Italy (`"ITA"`) is $0.2$ using a confidence interval and the Central Limit Theorem. We want to conduct our hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.01. Fill in the blanks to construct the confidence interval `[interval_left, interval_right]`. Your answer must use the Central Limit Theorem, not bootstrapping. Assume an integer variable `sample_size = len(winners)` has been defined, regardless of your answer to part 2.

Hint: 
```py
stats.norm.cdf(2.576) - stats.norm.cdf(-2.576) = 0.99
```

```py
    interval_center = __(i)__
    mystery = __(ii)__ * np.std(__(iii)__ ) / __(iv)__
    interval_left = interval_center - mystery
    interval_right = interval_center + mystery
```

What is our null hypothesis?

( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is not 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is greater than 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is less than 0.2.

What is our alternative hypothesis?

( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is not 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is greater than 0.2.
( ) The true proportion of stages won by Italy is less than 0.2.

Suppose we calculated the interval $[0.195, 0.253]$ using the above process. Should we reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis?

( ) Reject 
( ) Fail to reject
