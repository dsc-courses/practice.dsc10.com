Suppose the **distance** of a Tour de France stage and the **time** it takes to complete it are linearly associated with correlation coefficient $r = \frac{2}{3}$. Assume distances have a mean of 200 km and a standard deviation of 80 km. Times have a mean of 6 hours.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose the regression line to predict the time a stage will take (in
hours) based on its length (in km) predicts that a 160 km long stage
will take 5 hours. What is the standard deviation of the time it takes
to complete a stage?


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:**
$x_\text{su} = \frac{160 - 200}{80} = -\frac{1}{2}$. Then $y_\text{su} = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{1}{3} = \frac{5 - 6}{\text{SD}_y}$. So $\text{SD}_y = 3$ hours.

We know that $\bar{x} = 200$, $\sigma_x$ = 80, $r = \frac{2}{3}$, and $\bar{y} = 6$. In this problem we are given $x = 160$ and $y = 5$.
In order to find the standard deviation of time here, we can start by standardizing our values:

$x_{su} = \frac{160-200}{80} = -\frac{1}{2}$

Then according to the formula: $\text{Predicted}$ $y_{\text{su}} = r \cdot x_{\text{su}}$

$\text{Predicted}$ $y_{\text{su}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3}$

Now that we have $y$ in standard units, we can plug it into this formula to solve for the standard deviation of $y$:

$y_{su}  = \frac{y - \bar{y}}{\sigma_y}$

$- \frac{1}{3}= \frac{5-6}{\sigma_y}$

$\text{SD}_y = 3$

Suppose, regardless of your answer to part 1, that stage completion times have a standard deviation of 1.5 hours. The other means, SD, and $r$ are unchanged.

Stages in the middle of the Tour tend to be longer than those at the ends. Stage 14 is 60 km longer than stage 20, so we would expect it to take longer based on our linear association. How large will the difference in our predictions of stage completion times be?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:** $m = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1.5}{80} = \frac{1}{80}$. Stage 14 is 60 km longer, so we expect it to take $\frac{60}{80} = \frac{3}{4}$ hours longer.

Since we are interested in how much longer stage 14 is than stage 20 based on this linear association, we first want to calculate the slope. Note that $r=\frac{2}{3}$, $\text{SD}_y=1.5$, and $\text{SD}_x=80$: 

$m = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD}_y}{\text{SD}_x}$

$m = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1.5}{80} = \frac{1}{80}$

This means that for every additional 1km, time increases by $\frac{1}{80}$. 

Since Stage 14 is 60km longer than Stage 20, we simply multiply our slope by $60$, giving $\frac{60}{80} = \frac{3}{4}$. Thus we expect Stage 14 to take $\frac{3}{4}$ hours longer.

Suppose a mandatory rest break of 30 minutes (0.5 hours) is implemented for all Tour de France stages. How would the slope of the regression line change?

( ) It would decrease.
( ) It would stay the same.
( ) It would increase.
( ) We cannot say for sure.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:** It would stay the same.

Adding a 30 minute break to all the stages simply increases each stageâ€™s time by an additional 30 minutes. This would not change the slope since adding time simply shifts the time data points right, but doesn't change the relationship between distance and time.

Suppose the means and standard deviations above do not change (continue to assume times have a standard deviation of 1.5 hours), but the correlation coefficient $r$ is different. If we predict a 360 km stage will take 9 hours, what is the value of $r$? Write a single number for $r$ or "N/A" if it is not possible to answer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:** $r=1$

We can follow a similar process to part 1, but instead solve for $r$ now. First, we calculate $x$ in standard units:

$x_{\text{su}} = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{\text{SD}_x}$


$x_{\text{su}} = \frac{360-200}{80} = \frac{160}{80} = 2$

Now find $y$ in standard units:

$y_{\text{su}} = \frac{y - \bar{y}}{\text{SD}_y}$

$y_{\text{su}} = \frac{9-6}{1.5} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2$

Now we can solve for $r$ simply by $y_{\text{su}} = r * x_{\text{su}}$

$2 = r * 2$

$r=1$
