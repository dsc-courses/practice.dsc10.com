Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the
*proportion* of stages won by the country with the most stage wins.

```py
    stages.groupby(__(i)__).__(ii)__.get("Type").__(iii)__ / stages.shape[0]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- **(i)**: `"Winner Country"`  
    To calculate the number of stages won by each country, we need to group the data by the `Winner Country`. This will allow us to compute the counts for each group.

- **(ii)**: `count()`  
   Once the data is grouped, we use the `.count()` method to calculate the number of stages won by each country.

- **(iii)**: `max()`  
   Finds the maximum number of stages won by a single country. Finally, we divide the maximum stage wins by the total number of stages (`stages.shape[0]`) to calculate the proportion of stages won by the top country.

The distance of a stage alone does not encapsulate its difficulty, as riders feel more tired as the tour goes on. Because of this, we want to consider "real distance" a measurement of the length of a stage that takes into account how far into the tour the riders are. The "real distance" is calculated with the following process:

(i) Add one to the stage number.

(ii) Take the square root of the result of (i).

(iii) Multiply the result of (ii) by the raw distance of the stage.

Complete the implementation of the function `real_distance`, which takes in `stages` (a DataFrame), `stage` (a string, the name of the column containing stage numbers), and `distance` (a string, the name of the column containing stage distances). `real_distance` returns a Series containing all of the "real distances" of the stages, as calculated above.

```py
    def real_distance(stages, stage, distance):
         ________
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `return stages.get(distance) * np.sqrt(stages.get(stage) + 1)`

- **(i)**: First, We need to add one to the stage number. The `stage` parameter specifies the name of the column containing the stage numbers. `stages.get(stage)` retrieves this column as a Series, and we can directly add 1 to each element in the series by `stages.get(stage) + 1`

- **(ii)**: Then, to take the square root of the result of (i), we can use `np.sqrt(stages.get(stage) + 1)`

- **(iii)**: Finally, we want to multiply the result of (ii) by the raw distance of the stage. The `distance` parameter specifies the name of the column containing the raw distances of each stage.
`stages.get(distance)` retrieves this column as a pandas Series, and we can directly multiply it by `np.sqrt(stages.get(stage) + 1)`.

Sometimes, stages are repeated in different editions of the Tour de France, meaning that there are some pairs of `"Origin"` and `"Destination"` that appear more than once in `stages`. Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates how often the most common `"Origin"` and `"Destination"` pair in the `stages` DataFrame appears.

```py
stages.groupby(__(i)__).__(ii)__.sort_values(by = "Date").get("Type").iloc[__(iii)__]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- **(i)**: `["Origin", "Destination"]`  
   To analyze the frequency of stages with the same origin and destination, we need to group the data by the columns `["Origin", "Destination"]`. This groups the stages into unique pairs of origin and destination.

- **(ii)**: `count()`  
   After grouping, we apply the `.count()` method to calculate how many times each pair of `["Origin", "Destination"]` appears in the dataset. The result is the frequency of each pair.

- **(iii)**: `-1`  
   After obtaining the frequencies, we sort the resulting groups by their counts in ascending order (this is the default behavior of `.sort_values()`). The most common pair will then be the last entry in the sorted result. Using `.get("Type")` extracts the series of counts, and `.iloc[-1]` retrieves the count of the most common pair, which is at the last position of the sorted series.

Fill in the blanks so that the value of `mystery_three` is the `"Destination"` of the longest stage before Stage 12.

```py
    mystery = stages[stages.get(__(i)__) < 12]
    mystery_two = mystery.sort_values(by = "Distance", ascending = __(ii)__)
    mystery_three = mystery_two.get(__(iii)__).iloc[-1]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- **(i)**: `"Stage"`  
   To filter the DataFrame to include only rows corresponding to stages before Stage 12, we use the `"Stage"` column. The condition `stages.get("Stage") < 12` creates a boolean mask that selects only the rows where the stage number is less than 12.

- **(ii)**: `True`  
   To find the longest stage, the rows need to be sorted by the `"Distance"` column. Setting `ascending=True` ensures that shorter stages come first and the longest stage appears last in the sorted DataFrame.

- **(iii)**: `"Destination"`  
   After sorting, we want to retrieve the `"Destination"` of the longest stage. Using `.get("Destination")` retrieves the `"Destination"` column, and `.iloc[-1]` accesses the last row in the sorted DataFrame, corresponding to the longest stage before Stage 12.
