Choose the best tool to answer each of the following questions. Note the
following:

-   By "hypothesis testing," we mean "standard" hypothesis testing, i.e. hypothesis testing that doesn't involve permutation testing or bootstrapping.
-   By "bootstrapping," we mean bootstrapping that doesn't involve hypothesis testing.

What is the median distance of all Tour de France stages?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping
( ) Central Limit Theorem

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Bootstrapping

Since we want the median distance of all the Tour de France stages, we are not testing anything against a hypothesis at all which rules our hypothesis testing and permutation testing. We use bootstrapping to get samples in lieu of a population. Bootstrapping Tour de France distances will give samples of distances from which we can calculate the median of Tour de France stages.

Is the distribution of Tour de France stage types from before 1960 the same as after 1960?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping
( ) Central Limit Theorem

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Permutation Testing

We are comparing whether the distributions before 1960 and after 1960 are different which means we want to do permutation testing which tests whether two samples come from the same population distribution.

Are there an equal number of destinations that start with letters from the first half of the alphabet and destinations that start with letters from the second half of the alphabet?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping
( ) Central Limit Theorem

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Hypothesis Testing

We are testing whether two values (the number of destinations that start with letters from the first half of the alphabet and the destinations that start with letters from the second half of the alphabet) are equal to each other which is an indicator to use a hypothesis test. 

<average>50</average>

Are mountain stages with destinations in France from before 1970 longer than flat stages with destinations in Belgium from after 2000?

( ) Hypothesis Testing
( ) Permutation Testing
( ) Bootstrapping
( ) Central Limit Theorem

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Permutation Testing

We are comparing two distributions (mountain stages with destinations in France from before 1970 and flat stages with destinations in Belgium from after 2000) and seeing if the first distribution is longer than the second. Since we are comparing distributions, we want to perform a permutation test.
