We want to estimate the mean distance of Tour de France stages by bootstrapping 10,000 times and constructing a 90% confidence interval for the mean. In this question, suppose `random_stages` is a random sample of size 500 drawn with replacement from `stages`. Identify the line numbers with errors in the code below. In the adjacent box, point out the error by describing the mistake in less than 10 words or writing a code snippet (correct only the part you think is wrong). You may or may not need all the spaces provided below to identify errors.

```py

    line 1:      means = np.array([])
    line 2: 
    line 3:      for i in 10000:
    line 4:          resample = random_stages.sample(10000)
    line 5:          resample_mean = resample.get("Distance").mean()
    line 6:          np.append(means, resample_mean)
    line 7:    
    line 8:      left_bound = np.percentile(means, 0)
    line 9:      right_bound = np.percentile(means, 90)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- **a)**: 3: `for i in np.arange(10000):`  
    - The `for` loop syntax is incorrect. `10000` is an integer, not an iterable. To iterate 10,000 times, `np.arange(10000)` must be used.


- **b)**: 4: `random_stages.sample(500, replace=True)`  
    - The bootstrap sample size should be 500 (matching the original sample size). Additionally, `replace=True` is required for sampling with replacement.


- **c)**: 6: `means = np.append(means, resample_mean)`  
    - `np.append` does not modify the array in place. The `means` array must be reassigned to include the new value.


- **d)**: 8: `np.percentile(means, 5)`  
    - A 90% confidence interval captures the middle 90% of the data or distribution. This means we exclude 10% of the data: 5% from the lower tail and 5% from the upper tail. The 0th percentile is incorrect for a 90% confidence interval. The lower bound should be the 5th percentile.


- **e)**: 9: `np.percentile(means, 95)`  
    - The 90th percentile is incorrect for a 90% confidence interval. The upper bound should be the 95th percentile.


- **f)**: N/A: No more errors.
