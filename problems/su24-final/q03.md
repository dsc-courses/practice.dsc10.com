\[(12 pts)\] We want to estimate the mean distance of Tour de France
stages by bootstrapping 10,000 times and constructing a 90% confidence
interval for the mean. In this question, suppose `random_stages` is a
random sample of size 500 drawn with replacement from `stages`. Identify
the line numbers with errors in the code below. In the adjacent box,
point out the error by describing the mistake in less than 10 words or
writing a code snippet (correct only the part you think is wrong). You
may or may not need all the spaces provided below to identify errors.

    line 1:      means = np.array([])
    line 2: 
    line 3:      for i in 10000:
    line 4:          resample = random_stages.sample(10000)
    line 5:          resample_mean = resample.get("Distance").mean()
    line 6:          np.append(means, resample_mean)
    line 7:    
    line 8:      left_bound = np.percentile(means, 0)
    line 9:      right_bound = np.percentile(means, 90)
