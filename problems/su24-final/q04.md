Assume there are 100 stages in the random sample that generated this plot. If there are 5 stages in the bin `[275, 300)`, approximately how many stages are in the bin `[200, 225)`?

Assume the mean distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. At least what proportion of stage distances are guaranteed to lie between 0 km and 400 km? Do not simplify your answer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:** Using Chebyshev's inequality, we know at least $1 - \frac{1}{z^2}$ of the data lies within $z$ SDs. Here, $z = 4$ so we know $1 - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16}$ of the data lie in that range.

Again, assume the mean stage distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. Now, suppose we take a random sample of size 25 from the stage distances, calculate the mean stage distance of this sample, and repeat this process 500 times. What proportion of the means that we calculate will fall between 190 km and 210 km? Do not simplify your answer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Solution:** We know about 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean of any normal distribution. The distribution of means of samples of size 25 from this dataset is normally distributed with mean 200km and SD $\frac{50}{\sqrt{25}} = 10$, so 190km to 210km contains 68% of the values.

Assume the mean distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. Suppose we use the Central Limit Theorem to generate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages, and get the interval $[190\text{ km}, 210\text{ km}]$. Which of the following interpretations of this confidence interval are correct?

[ ] 95% of Tour de France stage distances fall between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] There is a 95% chance that the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages is between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] We are 95% confident that the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages is between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] Our sample is of size 100.
[ ] Our sample is of size 25.
[ ] If we collected many original samples and constructed many 95% confidence intervals, then exactly 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean distance.
[ ] If we collected many original samples and constructed many 95% confidence intervals, then roughly 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean distance.

Suppose we take 500 random samples of size 100 from the stage distances, calculate their means, and draw a histogram of the distribution of these sample means. We label this Histogram A. Then, we take 500 random samples of size 1000 from the stage distances, calculate their means, and draw a histogram of the distribution of these sample means. We label this Histogram B. Fill in the blanks so that the sentence below correctly describes how Histogram B looks in comparison to Histogram A.

"Relative to Histogram A, Histogram B would appear \_\_(i)\_\_ and shifted \_\_(ii)\_\_ due to the \_\_(iii)\_\_ mean and the \_\_(iv)\_\_ standard deviation."

(i): 

( ) thinner 
( ) wider 
( ) the same width 
( ) unknown

(ii): 

( ) left 
( ) right 
( ) not at all 
( ) unknown

(iii): 

( ) larger 
( ) smaller 
( ) unchanged 
( ) unknown

(iv): 

( ) larger 
( ) smaller 
( ) unchanged 
( ) unknown
