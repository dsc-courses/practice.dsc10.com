Which statement below correctly describes the relationship between the mean and the median of the sampled stage distances?

( ) The mean is significantly larger than the median.
( ) The mean is significantly smaller than the median.
( ) The mean is approximately equal to the median.
( ) It is impossible to know the relationship between the mean and the median.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** The mean is approximately equal to the median.

- The histogram appears to be **approximately symmetric**, with the peak near the center of the distribution. 
- For symmetric distributions, the **mean and the median are approximately equal** because the data is evenly distributed around the central point.
- If the distribution were skewed:
  - A **right-skewed distribution** would have the mean significantly larger than the median.
  - A **left-skewed distribution** would have the mean significantly smaller than the median.
- In this case, there is no visible skew, so the correct answer is that the mean is approximately equal to the median.

Assume there are 100 stages in the random sample that generated this plot. If there are 5 stages in the bin `[275, 300)`, approximately how many stages are in the bin `[200, 225)`?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $35 = 5\cdot7$

- The height of the bin `[200, 225)` on the density histogram is approximately **7 times** the height of the bin `[275, 300)`.  
- Since the number of stages in a bin is proportional to the binâ€™s height, the number of stages in `[200, 225)` is **$35 = 5\cdot7$**.

Assume the mean distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. At least what proportion of stage distances are guaranteed to lie between 0 km and 400 km? Do not simplify your answer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{15}{16}$

Using Chebyshev's inequality, we know at least $1 - \frac{1}{z^2}$ of the data lies within $z$ SDs. Here, $z = 4$ so we know $1 - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16}$ of the data lie in that range.

Again, assume the mean stage distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. Now, suppose we take a random sample of size 25 from the stage distances, calculate the mean stage distance of this sample, and repeat this process 500 times. What proportion of the means that we calculate will fall between 190 km and 210 km? Do not simplify your answer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 68%  

We know about 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean of any normal distribution. The distribution of means of samples of size 25 from this dataset is normally distributed with mean 200km and SD $\frac{50}{\sqrt{25}} = 10$, so 190km to 210km contains 68% of the values.

Assume the mean distance is 200 km and the standard deviation is 50 km. Suppose we use the Central Limit Theorem to generate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages, and get the interval $[190\text{ km}, 210\text{ km}]$. Which of the following interpretations of this confidence interval are correct?

[ ] 95% of Tour de France stage distances fall between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] There is a 95% chance that the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages is between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] We are 95% confident that the true mean distance of all Tour de France stages is between 190 km and 210 km.
[ ] Our sample is of size 100.
[ ] Our sample is of size 25.
[ ] If we collected many original samples and constructed many 95% confidence intervals, then exactly 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean distance.
[ ] If we collected many original samples and constructed many 95% confidence intervals, then roughly 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean distance.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Option 3, Option 4, and Option 7 

**Option 1:**  
   **Incorrect.** Confidence intervals describe the uncertainty in estimating the population mean, not the proportion of data points. A 95% confidence interval does not imply that 95% of individual stage distances fall between 190 km and 210 km.

**Option 2:**  
   **Incorrect.** Confidence intervals are based on the sampling process, not probability. Once the interval is calculated, the true mean is either inside or outside the interval. We cannot assign a probability to this.

**Option 3:**  
   **Correct.** This is the standard interpretation of confidence intervals: "We are 95% confident that the true mean lies within the interval."

**Option 4:**  
   **Correct.**  Given a sample size of 100 and population standard deviation of 50, the confidence interval \([190, 210]\) is consistent with the calculation using the rule of thumb that a 95% confidence interval is approximately **2 standard deviations apart from the mean**. 
 
   For a 95% confidence interval, the range can be approximated as:

$$
\left[\text{sample mean} - 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}},
\text{sample mean} + 2\cdot \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}
\right]
$$

Substituting the given values:

   - Sample mean = 200
   - Sample standard deviation = 50
   - Sample size = 100
   $$
   \text{CI} = 
   \left[
   200 - 2\cdot \frac{50}{\sqrt{100}}, 
   200 + 2\cdot \frac{50}{\sqrt{100}}
   \right]
   $$
   Simplify:
   $$
   \text{CI} = 
   \left[
   200 - 2\cdot 5, 
   200 + 2\cdot 5
   \right]
   $$
   $$
   \text{CI} = [190, 210]
   $$


**Option 5:**  
   **Incorrect.** refer to option 4

**Option 6:**  
   **Incorrect.** The wording "exactly 95%" is overly precise. In practice, confidence intervals are based on the sampling process, and we use "approximately" or "roughly" 95%.

**Option 7:**  
   **Correct.** By definition of a confidence interval, if we repeatedly sampled and constructed 95% confidence intervals, roughly 95% of them would contain the true mean.

Suppose we take 500 random samples of size 100 from the stage distances, calculate their means, and draw a histogram of the distribution of these sample means. We label this Histogram A. Then, we take 500 random samples of size 1000 from the stage distances, calculate their means, and draw a histogram of the distribution of these sample means. We label this Histogram B. Fill in the blanks so that the sentence below correctly describes how Histogram B looks in comparison to Histogram A.

"Relative to Histogram A, Histogram B would appear \_\_(i)\_\_ and shifted \_\_(ii)\_\_ due to the \_\_(iii)\_\_ mean and the \_\_(iv)\_\_ standard deviation."

(i): 

( ) thinner 
( ) wider 
( ) the same width 
( ) unknown

(ii): 

( ) left 
( ) right 
( ) not at all 
( ) unknown

(iii): 

( ) larger 
( ) smaller 
( ) unchanged 
( ) unknown

(iv): 

( ) larger 
( ) smaller 
( ) unchanged 
( ) unknown

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

- **(i):** thinner  
  - Histogram B would appear **thinner** because larger sample sizes reduce the variability of the sample means. With a sample size of 1000 (compared to 100 for Histogram A), the standard error decreases, leading to a narrower distribution. 

- **(ii):** not at all  
  - Histogram B would **not shift** left or right because the sample mean does not depend on the sample size. Both histograms have the same mean, as they are based on the same population.

- **(iii):** unchanged  
  - The mean remains **unchanged** because the mean of the sampling distribution (the population mean) does not depend on sample size.

- **(iv):** smaller  
  - The standard deviation of Histogram B is **smaller** because $$\text{SD of Distribution of Possible Sample Means} = \frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}$$
  
  Increasing sample size from 100 to 1000 decreases the Sample standard deviation as the Population standard deviation remains unchanged, leading to a smaller standard deviation for the sampling distribution.
