King Triton had four children, and each of his four children started
their own families. These four families organize a Triton family reunion
each year. The compositions of the four families are as follows:

-   Family W: `"1a4c"`

-   Family X: `"2a1c"`

-   Family Y: `"2a3c"`

-   Family Z: `"1a1c"`

Suppose we choose one of the fifteen people at the Triton family reunion
at random.

At the reunion, the Tritons play a game that involves placing the four
letters into a hat (W, X, Y, and Z, corresponding to the four families).
Then, **five times**, they draw a letter from the hat, write it down on
a piece of paper, and place it back into the hat.

Let $p = \frac{1}{4}$ in the questions that follow.
