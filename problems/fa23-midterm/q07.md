King Triton had four children, and each of his four children started
their own families. These four families organize a Triton family reunion
each year. The compositions of the four families are as follows:

-   Family W: `"1a4c"`

-   Family X: `"2a1c"`

-   Family Y: `"2a3c"`

-   Family Z: `"1a1c"`

Suppose we choose one of the fifteen people at the Triton family reunion
at random.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Given that the chosen individual is from a family with one child, what
is the probability that they are from Family X? Give your answer as a
simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{3}{5}$

Given that the chosen individual is from a family with one child, we
know that they must be from either Family X or Family Z. There are three
individuals in Family X, and there are a 
total of five individuals from these two families. Thus,
the probability of choosing any one of the three individuals from Family
X out of the five individuals from both families is $\frac{3}{5}$.

Consider the events $A$ and $B$, defined below.

-   $A$: The chosen individual is an adult.

-   $B$: The chosen individual is a child.

True or False: Events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

If two events are independent, knowledge of one event happening
does not change the probability of the other event happening. In this case, events
$A$ and $B$ are not independent because knowledge of one event gives complete knowledge of the other.

To see this, note that the probability of choosing a child randomly out of the fifteen individuals is $\frac{9}{15}$. That is, $P(B) = \frac{9}{15}$.

Suppose now that we know that the chosen individual is an adult. In this case, the probability that the chosen individual is a child is $0$, because nobody is both a child and an adult. That is, $P(B \text{ given } A) = 0$, which is not the same as $P(B) = \frac{9}{15}$.

This problem illustrates the difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events. In this case $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, because they cannot both happen. But that forces them to be dependent events, because knowing that someone is an adult completely determines the probability that they are a child (it's zero!)

Consider the events $C$ and $D$, defined below.

-   $C$: The chosen individual is a child.

-   $D$: The chosen individual is from family $Y$.

True or False: Events $C$ and $D$ are independent.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** True

If two events are independent, the probability of one event happening 
does not change when we know that the other event happens. In this case, events
$C$ and $D$ are indeed independent.

If we know that the chosen individual is a child, the probability that they come from Family Y is $\frac{3}{9}$, which simplifies to 
$\frac{1}{3}$. That is $P(D \text{ given } C) = \frac{1}{3}$.

On the other hand, without any prior knowledge, when we select someone randomly from all fifteen individuals, the probability they come from Family Y is $\frac{5}{15}$, which also simplifies to $\frac{1}{3}$. This says $P(D) = \frac{1}{3}$. 

In other words, knowledge of $C$ is irrelevant to the probability of $D$ occurring, which means $C$ and $D$ are independent.

At the reunion, the Tritons play a game that involves placing the four
letters into a hat (W, X, Y, and Z, corresponding to the four families).
Then, **five times**, they draw a letter from the hat, write it down on
a piece of paper, and place it back into the hat.

Let $p = \frac{1}{4}$ in the questions that follow.

What is the probability that Family W is selected all 5 times?

( ) $p^5$
( ) $1 - p^5$
( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.
# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $p^5$

The probability of selecting Family W in the first round is $p$, which is the same for
the second round, the third round, and so on.
Each of the chosen letters is drawn independently from the others because the 
result of one draw does not affect the result of the next. We 
can apply the multiplication rule here and multiply the probabilities of 
choosing Family W in each round. This comes out to be
$p\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p$, which is $p^5$.

What is the probability that Family W is selected at least once?

( ) $p^5$
( ) $1 - p^5$
( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $1 - (1 - p)^5$

Since there are too many ways that Family W can be selected to meet the 
condition that it is selected at least once, it is easier if we calculate
the probability that Family W is never selected and subtract that from 1.
The probability that Family W is not selected in the first round is $1-p$, which is the 
same for the second round, the third round, and so on. We want this to happen for all five 
rounds, and since the events are independent, we can multiply their 
probabilities all together. This comes out to be $(1-p)^5$, which represents the probability that Family W is never selected. Finally, we 
subtract $(1-p)^5$ from 1 to find the probability that Family W is selected at least once, giving the answer $1 - (1-p)^5$.

What is the probability that Family W is selected exactly once, as 
   the last family that is selected?

( ) $p^5$
( ) $1 - p^5$
( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$

We want to find the probability of Family W being selected only as the
last draw, and not in the first four draws. The probability that Family
W is not selected in the first draw is $(1-p)$, which is the same for the second, third, and fourth draws. 
For the fifth draw, the probability of choosing Family W is $p$. Since the draws are independent, we can multiply 
these probabilities together, which comes out to be $(1-p)^4 \cdot p = p\cdot (1-p)^4$.
