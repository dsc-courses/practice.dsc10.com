King Triton had four children, and each of his four children started
their own families. These four families organize a Triton family reunion
each year. The compositions of the four families are as follows:

-   Family W: `"1a4c"`

-   Family X: `"2a1c"`

-   Family Y: `"2a3c"`

-   Family Z: `"1a1c"`

Suppose we choose one of the fifteen people at the Triton family reunion
at random.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Given that the chosen individual is from a family with one child, what
is the probability that they are from Family X? Give your answer as a
simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{3}{5}$

Given that the chosen individual is from a family with one child, we
know that they must be from either Family X or Family Z. There are three
individuals in Family X, and there are a 
total of five individuals from these two families. Thus, we are finding
the probability of choosing any one of the three individuals from Family
X out of the total five individuals.

Consider the events $A$ and $B$, defined below.

-   $A$: The chosen individual is an adult.

-   $B$: The chosen individual is a child.

True or False: Events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

If two events are independent, the probability of one event happening 
does not change given that the other event happens. In this case, events
A and B are not independent. 

If given that the chosen individual is an adult, the probability that 
the chosen individual is a child is 0. On the other hand, the probability 
of choosing a child randomly out of the fifteen individuals is $\frac{9}{15}$. 

If given that the chosen individual is a child, the probability that the 
chosen individual is an adult is 0. On the other hand, the probability of 
choosing an adult randomly out of the fiften individuals is $\frac{6}{15}$.

Consider the events $C$ and $D$, defined below.

-   $C$: The chosen individual is a child.

-   $D$: The chosen individual is from family $Y$.

True or False: Events $C$ and $D$ are independent.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** True

If two events are independent, the probability of one event happening 
does not change given that the other event happens. In this case, events
C and D are indeed independent.

If given that the chosen individual is a child, the probability that the 
chosen individual is from Family Y is $\frac{3}{9}$, which simplifies to 
$\frac{1}{3}$. On the other hand, the probability that the individual, chosen randomly out of all fifteen individuals, is from Family Y is $\frac{5}{15}$, 
which also simplifies to $\frac{1}{3}$.

If given that the chosen individual is from Family Y, the probability 
that the chosen individual is a child is $\frac{3}{5}$. On the other hand,
the probability that the individual, chosen randomly out of all fifteen 
individuals, is a child is $\frac{9}{15}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{5}$.

At the reunion, the Tritons play a game that involves placing the four
letters into a hat (W, X, Y, and Z, corresponding to the four families).
Then, **five times**, they draw a letter from the hat, write it down on
a piece of paper, and place it back into the hat.

Let $p = \frac{1}{4}$ in the questions that follow.

What is the probability that Family W is selected all 5 times?

( ) $p^5$
( ) $1 - p^5$
( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.
# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $p^5$

The probability of selecting Family W in the first round is p, same for
the second round, and the third, and so on.
Each of the choosing events is independent from one another because the 
result of the previous event does not affect the result of the next. We 
can apply the multiplication rule here and multiply the probability of 
choosing Family W in each event together. This comes out to be
$p\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p$, which is $p^5$.

( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $1 - (1 - p)^5$

Since there are too many ways that Family W can be selected to meet the 
condition that it is selected at least once, it is easier if we calculate
the probability that Family W is never selected and subtract that from 1.
The probability that Family W is not selected in the first round is $1-p$,
same for the second round, and so on. We want this to happen for all five 
rounds, and since the events are independent, we can multiply their 
probabilities all together. This comes out to be $(1-p)^5$. Finally, we 
subtract $(1-p)^5$ from 1 to find the probability of all other events 
other than this one event, giving us the answer $1 - (1-p)^5$.

What is the probability that Family W is selected exactly once, as 
   the last family that is selected?

( ) $p^5$
( ) $1 - p^5$
( ) $1 - (1 - p)^5$
( ) $(1 - p)^5$
( ) $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$
( ) $p^4 (1 - p)$
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $p \cdot (1 - p)^4$

We want to find the probability of Family W being selected only in the
last event, and not in the first four events. The probability that Family
W is not selected in the first event is (1-p), same for the second event, 
the third, and the fourth. Since the events are independent, we can multiply 
their probabilities together, which comes out to be $(1-p)^4$. For the 
fifth event, the probability of choosing Family W is p. At the end, we 
multiply the probabilities from the first four events with the fifth event
and get $p\cdot (1-p)^4$
