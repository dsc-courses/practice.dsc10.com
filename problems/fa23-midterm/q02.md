# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we define the three variables below.

    J = living_cost.get("county") == "Benton County"
    K = living_cost.get("state") == "IN"
    L = living_cost.get("family_type") == "1a2c"

Feel free to use these variables in your solutions to the following
questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the average
yearly childcare cost for families with one adult and two children in
Benton County, IN.

        __(a)__.__(b)__.iloc[0]

1.  What goes in blank (a)?

2.  What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 

1. `living_cost[J & K & L]`

The first step in the expression is to query the rows in the DataFrame that meet our specific criteria.  In this case, we want the rows in the DataFrame where the county is "Benton County", the state is "IN", and the family has 1 adult and 2 children.  J, K, and L specify these criteria. When used to query in the `living_cost` DataFrame we are able to obtain a DataFrame with these rows.

<average>69</average>

**Answer:** 

2. `get("avg_childcare_cost")`

Once we have a DataFrame that contains the rows we need, we can specify which column to extract the entry from.  In this case, we want the average yearly childcare cost, so this code gets the "avg_childcare_cost" column.

<average>57</average>



# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below evaluates to the number
of states with a county named Benton County.

        __(c)__.__(d)__ / 10

1.  What goes in blank (c)?


2.  What goes in blank (d)?


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `living_cost[J]`

Since we want to find how many states have a county named "Benton County", we first want to obtain all the rows of the DataFrame where the county is "Benton County".  Variable J specifies this condition, so it is used to query the rows in `living_cost` where the county is "Benton County."

<average>60</average>

**Answer:** `shape[0]`

Now that we have all the rows in the DataFrame where the county is "Benton County", to find how many counties there are, we can use `.shape`, which gets the dimensions of the resulting DataFrame.  `.shape` returns a tuple of the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame. To get the number of rows, we index at [0].

<average>40</average>
