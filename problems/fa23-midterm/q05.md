The rows in `living_cost` with a `"family_type"` value of `"1a0c"`
correspond to families that consist of individuals living on their own.
We'll call such families "solo families.\" Below, we've visualized the
distribution of the `"median_income"` column, but only for rows
corresponding to solo families. Instead of visualizing median incomes in
dollars, we've visualized them in thousands of dollars.

Suppose we're interested in splitting the $[50, 80)$ bin into two
separate bins --- a $[50, 70)$ bin and a $[70, 80)$ bin.

Let $h_1$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the $[50, 70)$
bin and let $h_2$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the
$[70, 80)$ bin.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What are the minimum and maximum possible values of $h_2$? Give your
answers as **decimals rounded to three decimal places**.

Suppose that the number of counties in which the median income of solo
families is in the interval $[50, 70)$ is $r$ times the number of
counties in which the median income of solo families is in the interval
$[70, 80)$. Given this fact, what is the value of $$\frac{h_1}{h_2},$$
the ratio of the heights of the two new bars?

( ) $\frac{1}{r}$
( ) $\frac{2}{r}$
( ) $\frac{3}{r}$
( ) $\frac{r}{2}$
( ) $\frac{r}{3}$
( ) $2r$
( ) $3r$
