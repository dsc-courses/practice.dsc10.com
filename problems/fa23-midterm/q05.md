The rows in `living_cost` with a `"family_type"` value of `"1a0c"`
correspond to families that consist of individuals living on their own.
We'll call such families "solo families.\" Below, we've visualized the
distribution of the `"median_income"` column, but only for rows
corresponding to solo families. Instead of visualizing median incomes in
dollars, we've visualized them in thousands of dollars.

Suppose we're interested in splitting the $[50, 80)$ bin into two
separate bins --- a $[50, 70)$ bin and a $[70, 80)$ bin.

Let $h_1$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the $[50, 70)$
bin and let $h_2$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the
$[70, 80)$ bin.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What are the minimum and maximum possible values of $h_2$? Give your
answers as **decimals rounded to three decimal places**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Minimum: 0.000

In a histogram, we do not know how data are distributed within a bin. This means that when we split the bin with range $[50,80)$ into two
smaller bins, we have no way of knowing how the data from the original bin will be distributed. It is possible that all of the data in the $[50,80)$ bin
fell between $50$ and $70$. In this case, there would be no data in the $[70, 80)$ bin, and as such, the height of this new bar would be $0.000$.

**Answer**: Maximum: 0.072

The logic for determining the maximum height of $h_2$ is the same as determining the minimum. If all of the data in the original $[50,80)$ bin fell between $70$ and $80$,
all of the data that were originally in the $[50, 80)$ bin would be allocated to the $[70,80)$ bin. Determining the height of this bin is the next step. In a density histogram,
the area of a bar corresponds to the proportion of the data contained within the bar (a bar with area $0.5$ contains $50%$ of the total data). If the maximum height of $h_2$
is reached when the bin $[70,80)$ contains all of the data originally contained in the bin $[50,80)$, the area of the $[70,80)$ bar must be the same as the original area of the
$[50,80)$ bar, since the proportion of data within the $[70,80)$ bar is the same as what was originally contained in the $[50,80)$ bar. This is the tricky part, and once we know
this, we simply do arithmetic with the original bar to determine the answer: <br/> $a1 = a2$ <br/> $(30 * 0.024) = (10 * h_2)$, and <br/> $h_2 = 0.072$. And the problem is solved.

Suppose that the number of counties in which the median income of solo
families is in the interval $[50, 70)$ is $r$ times the number of
counties in which the median income of solo families is in the interval
$[70, 80)$. Given this fact, what is the value of $$\frac{h_1}{h_2},$$
the ratio of the heights of the two new bars?

( ) $\frac{1}{r}$
( ) $\frac{2}{r}$
( ) $\frac{3}{r}$
( ) $\frac{r}{2}$
( ) $\frac{r}{3}$
( ) $2r$
( ) $3r$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**
$\frac{r}{2}$

The trick to solving this problem is recognizing that the number of counties in a given interval is directly related to
the area of that interval's bar in the histogram. This comes from the property of density histograms that
the area of a bar corresponds to the proportion of the data contained within the bar (If the area of a bar is $0.5$, then that bar contains $50%$ of the data).
Given that there are $r$ times the amount of data in the interval $[50, 70)$, in comparison to the interval $[70,80)$, we know that the
_area_ of the bar with base $[50,70)$ is $r$ times the area of the bar with base $[70,80). As such, we have the following equation and simplification:<br/>
$A_1 = A_2$<br/>
$h_1 * b_1 = r * h_2 * b_2$<br/>
We are given the bases of both of the bins, and $b_1$, $[50,70)$, is twice the length of $b_2$, $[70,80)$. So, $b_1 = 2b_2$, and <br/>
$h_1 * 2b_2 = r * h_2 * b_2$<br/>
From here, we can rearrange terms to get <br/>
$h_1 * 2  = r * h_2$<br/>
$\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{r}{2}$
