The rows in `living_cost` with a `"family_type"` value of `"1a0c"`
correspond to families that consist of individuals living on their own.
We'll call such families "solo families.\" Below, we've visualized the
distribution of the `"median_income"` column, but only for rows
corresponding to solo families. Instead of visualizing median incomes in
dollars, we've visualized them in thousands of dollars.

Suppose we're interested in splitting the $[50, 80)$ bin into two
separate bins --- a $[50, 70)$ bin and a $[70, 80)$ bin.

Let $h_1$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the $[50, 70)$
bin and let $h_2$ be the height of the new bar corresponding to the
$[70, 80)$ bin.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What are the minimum and maximum possible values of $h_2$? Give your
answers as **decimals rounded to three decimal places**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: Minimum: 0

In a histogram, we do not know how data are distributed within a bin. This means that when we split the bin with range $[50, 80)$ into two
smaller bins, we have no way of knowing how the data from the original bin will be distributed. It is possible that all of the data in the $[50, 80)$ bin
fell between $50$ and $70$. In this case, there would be no data in the $[70, 80)$ bin, and as such, the height of this new bar would be $0$.

**Answer**: Maximum: 0.072

Similarly, if all of the data in the original $[50,80)$ bin fell between $70$ and $80, then all of the data that was originally in the $[50, 80)$ bin would be allocated to the $[70, 80)$ bin. In a density histogram,
the area of a bar corresponds to the proportion of the data contained within the bar (for example, a bar with area $0.5$ contains $50%$ of the total data). Since the maximum value of $h_2$ is achieved when the bin $[70, 80)$ contains all of the data originally contained in the bin $[50, 80)$, this means area of the $[70, 80)$ bar must be the same as the original area of the
$[50, 80)$ bar, since it contains the same proportion of data. 

The original bar had area $30 * 0.024 = 0.72$, which comes from multiplying its base and its height. Since the new bar has a base of $10$, its height must be $0.072$ to make its area equal to $0.72$. Intuitively, if a rectangle is one third as wide as another rectangle and has the same area, it must be three times as tall.

Suppose that the number of counties in which the median income of solo
families is in the interval $[50, 70)$ is $r$ times the number of
counties in which the median income of solo families is in the interval
$[70, 80)$. Given this fact, what is the value of $$\frac{h_1}{h_2},$$
the ratio of the heights of the two new bars?

( ) $\frac{1}{r}$
( ) $\frac{2}{r}$
( ) $\frac{3}{r}$
( ) $\frac{r}{2}$
( ) $\frac{r}{3}$
( ) $2r$
( ) $3r$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{r}{2}$

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the number of counties in a given interval is directly related to the area of that interval's bar in the histogram. This comes from the property of density histograms that the area of a bar corresponds to the proportion of the data contained within the bar.

Given that there are $r$ times the amount of data in the interval $[50, 70)$, in comparison to the interval $[70, 80)$, we know that the _area_ of the bar corresponding to the bin $[50, 70)$ is $r$ times the area of the bar corresponding to the bin $[70, 80)$. 

Therefore, if $A_1$ represents the area of the $[50, 70)$ bar and $A_2$ represents the area of the $[70, 80)$ bar, we have

$$
A_1 = r \cdot A_2.
$$

Then, since each bar is a rectangle, its area comes from the product of its height and its base. We know the $[50, 70)$ bar has a base of $20$ and a height of $h_1$, and the $[70, 80)$ bar has a base of $10$ and a height of $h_2$. Plugging this in gives

$$
h_1 \cdot 20 = r \cdot h_2 \cdot 10.
$$

From here, we can rearrange terms to get

$$
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{r}{2}.
$$
