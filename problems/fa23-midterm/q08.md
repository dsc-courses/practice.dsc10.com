After the family reunion, Family Y gets together with nine other
families to play a game. All ten families (which we'll number 1 through
10) have a composition of `"2a3c"`. Within each family, the three
children are labeled `"oldest"`, `"middle"`, or `"youngest"`.

In this game, the numbers 1 through 10, representing the ten families,
are placed into a hat. Then, **five times**, they draw a number from the
hat, write it down on a piece of paper, and place it back into the hat.
If a family's number is written down on the paper at least twice, then
two of the three children in that family are randomly selected to win a
prize. The same child cannot be selected to win a prize twice.

Chiachan is the middle child in Family 4. He writes a simulation, which
is partially provided on the next page. Fill in the blanks so that after
running the simulation,

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome Q") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that Chiachan wins a prize.

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome R") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that both of Chiachan's siblings win a
    prize, but Chiachan does not.

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome S") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that nobody from Chiachan's family wins
    a prize.

What goes in blank (a)?

( ) `replace=True`
( ) `replace=False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `replace=True`

A family can be selected more than once, as indicated by "placing the number back into
the hat" in the problem statement. Therefore we use `replace=True` to allow for the same family to get picked more than once.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4) >= 2` or equivalent

Notice that inside the body of the `if` statement, the first line defines a variable `children` which selects two children from among `ages`. We are told in the problem statement that if a family's number is written down on the paper at least twice, then
two of the three children in that family are randomly selected to win a
prize. Therefore, the condition that we want to check in the `if` statement should correspond to Chiachan's family number (4) being written down on the paper at least twice.

When we compare the entire `fams` array to the value 4 using `fams == 4`, the result is an array of `True` or `False` values, where each `True` represents an instance of Chiachan's family being chosen. Then `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4)` evaluates to the number of `True`s, because in Python, `True` is 1 and `False` is 0. That is, `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4)` represents the number of times Chichan's family is selected, and so our condition is `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4) >= 2`. 

There are many equivalent ways to write this same condition, including `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4) > 1` and `(fams == 4).sum() >= 2`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `replace=True`
( ) `replace=False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `replace=False`

A child cannot win a prize twice, so we remove them from the pool 
after being selected.

<average>86</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (d)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Outcome R"` 

Chiachan is the middle child in the family, and recall that each outcome 
corresponds to either Chiachan winning (`"Outcome Q"`), Chiachan not winning but his siblings winning (`"Outcome R"`), or nobody in his family winning (`"Outcome S"`).

This condition checks the negation of the middle child being selected, which evaluates to `True` when Chiachan's siblings win but he doesn't, so we append `"Outcome R"` to the `outcomes` array in this case.

<average>76</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (e)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Outcome Q"` 

Chiachan is the middle child in the family, and recall that each outcome 
corresponds to either Chiachan winning (`"Outcome Q"`), Chiachan not winning but his siblings winning (`"Outcome R"`), or nobody in his family winning (`"Outcome S"`).

This condition corresponds to the middle child being selected, so we append `"Outcome Q"` to the `outcomes` array in this case.
<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (f)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Outcome S"` 

Chiachan is the middle child in the family, and recall that each outcome 
corresponds to either Chiachan winning (`"Outcome Q"`), Chiachan not winning but his siblings winning (`"Outcome R"`), or nobody in his family winning (`"Outcome S"`).

This condition is that Chichan's family was not selected two or more times, which means nobody in his family will win a prize, so we append `"Outcome S"` to the `outcomes` array in this case.
