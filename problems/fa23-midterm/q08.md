After the family reunion, Family Y gets together with nine other
families to play a game. All ten families (which we'll number 1 through
10) have a composition of `"2a3c"`. Within each family, the three
children are labeled `"oldest"`, `"middle"`, or `"youngest"`.

In this game, the numbers 1 through 10, representing the ten families,
are placed into a hat. Then, **five times**, they draw a number from the
hat, write it down on a piece of paper, and place it back into the hat.
If a family's number is written down on the paper at least twice, then
two of the three children in that family are randomly selected to win a
prize. The same child cannot be selected to win a prize twice.

Chiachan is the middle child in Family 4. He writes a simulation, which
is partially provided on the next page. Fill in the blanks so that after
running the simulation,

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome Q") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that Chiachan wins a prize.

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome R") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that both of Chiachan's siblings win a
    prize, but Chiachan does not.

-   `np.count_nonzero(outcomes == "Outcome S") / repetitions` gives an
    estimate of the probability that nobody from Chiachan's family wins
    a prize.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (a)?

( ) `replace=True`
( ) `replace=False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `replace=True`

**Explanation:** A family can be selected more than twice to be initialized in the
`fams` array, therefore we use `replace=True`.

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `np.count_nonzero(fams == 4) >= 2` or equivalent

**Explanation:** We want to separate the conditions of what outcomes to append to the outcomes array. 
To do this we can condition on checking how many elements in the fams array equal 4, representing the 
case that Chiachan's family is chosen. To do this in one line, `np.count_nonzero()` is used, avoiding
the use of a for loop.

<average>17</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `replace=True`
( ) `replace=False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `replace=False`

**Explanation:** A child cannot win the same prize, so we remove them from the pool 
after being selected.

<average>86</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (d)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `Outcome R` 

**Explanation:** Chiachan is the middle child in the family, and recall that each outcome 
corresponds to either Chiachan winning, his family members winning, or none of them winning.
This condition checks the negation of the middle child being selected, so we append `Outcome R`
which corresponds to one of his siblings being selected.

<average>76</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (e)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `Outcome Q` 

**Explanation:** Chiachan is the middle child in the family, and recall that each outcome 
corresponds to either Chiachan winning, his family members winning, or none of them winning.
When the middle child is selected, we append `Outcome Q`, representing the corresponding situation.

<average>75</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (f)?

( ) `"Outcome Q"`
( ) `"Outcome R"`
( ) `"Outcome S"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `Outcome S` 

**Explanation:** In the case that no one in Chiachan's family is selected, 
we append the corresponding `Outcome S`.

<average>80</average>
