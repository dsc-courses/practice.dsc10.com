Recall that `living_cost` has $31430$ rows, one for each of the ten
possible `"family_type"` values in each of the $3143$ US counties.

Consider the function `state_merge`, defined below.

    def state_merge(A, B):
        state_A = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == A]
        state_B = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == B]
        return state_A.merge(state_B, on="family_type").shape[0]

Suppose Montana (`"MT"`) has 5 counties, and suppose
`state_merge("MT", "NV")` evaluates to `1050`. How many counties does
Nevada (`"NV"`) have? Give your answer as an integer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer** $21$

As there are $10$ possible `"family_type"` values per county, merging two DataFrames on `"family_type"` results
in an interesting over-counting. For each `"family_type"` in `"MT"`, there will be $10$ matching `"family_type"` values
in `"NV"`. In addition, this over-counting will happen for each pair of counties between `"MT"` and `"NV"`, due to the nature
of merging. As such, to determine the number of counties in `"NV"`, we must first reverse the over-counting due to the presence of
$10$ family types, and also reverse the matching of each county to every other county in `"MT"`. This means
that our answer can be reached by first dividing the number of rows in the merged DataFrame by $10$, and then by $5$ (The number of counties in `"MT"`). This results in <br/>
$1050 / 10 / 5 = 105 / 5 = 21$<br/>The number of counties in `"NV"` is $21$, and the problem is solved.
