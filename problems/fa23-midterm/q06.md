Recall that `living_cost` has $31430$ rows, one for each of the ten
possible `"family_type"` values in each of the $3143$ US counties.

Consider the function `state_merge`, defined below.

    def state_merge(A, B):
        state_A = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == A]
        state_B = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == B]
        return state_A.merge(state_B, on="family_type").shape[0]

Suppose Montana (`"MT"`) has 5 counties, and suppose
`state_merge("MT", "NV")` evaluates to `1050`. How many counties does
Nevada (`"NV"`) have? Give your answer as an integer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer** $21$

We are told Montana has 5 counties. We don't know how many counties Nevada has, but let's call the number of counties in Nevada $x$ and see how many rows the merged DataFrame should have, in terms of $x$. If Montana has 5 counties, since there are 10 `"family_type"` values per county, this means the `state_A` DataFrame has 50 rows. 

Similarly, if Nevada has $x$ counties, then `state_B` has $10x$ rows. When we merge on `"family_type"`, each of the 5 rows in `state_A` with a given `"family_type"` (say `"2a3c"`) will match with each of the $x$ rows in `state_B` with that same `"family_type"`. This will lead to $5x$ rows in the output corresponding to each `"family_type"`, and since there are 10 different values for `"family_type"`, this means the final output will have $50x$ rows.

We are told that the merged DataFrame has $1050$ rows, so we can find $x$ by solving $50x = 1050$, which leads to $x = 21$.
