Recall that `living_cost` has $31430$ rows, one for each of the ten
possible `"family_type"` values in each of the $3143$ US counties.

Consider the function `state_merge`, defined below.

    def state_merge(A, B):
        state_A = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == A]
        state_B = living_cost[living_cost.get("state") == B]
        return state_A.merge(state_B, on="family_type").shape[0]

Suppose Montana (`"MT"`) has 5 counties, and suppose
`state_merge("MT", "NV")` evaluates to `1050`. How many counties does
Nevada (`"NV"`) have? Give your answer as an integer.
