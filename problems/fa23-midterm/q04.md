For those who plan on having children, an important consideration when
deciding whether to live in an area is the cost of raising children in
that area. The DataFrame `expensive`, defined below, contains all of the
rows in `living_cost` where the `"avg_childcare_cost"` is at least
\$20,000.

    expensive = living_cost[living_cost.get("avg_childcare_cost") 
                            >= 20000]

We'll call a county an "expensive county\" if there is **at least one**
`"family_type"` in that county with an `"avg_childcare_cost"` of at
least \$20,000. Note that all expensive counties appear in the
`expensive` DataFrame, but some may appear multiple times (if they have
multiple `"family_type"`s with an `"avg_childcare_cost"` of at least
\$20,000).

Recall that the `"is_metro"` column contains Boolean values indicating
whether or not each county is part of a metropolitan (urban) area. For
all rows of `living_cost` (and, hence, `expensive`) corresponding to the
same geographic location, the value of `"is_metro"` is the same. For
instance, every row corresponding to San Diego County has an
`"is_metro"` value of `True`.

Fill in the blanks below so that the result is a DataFrame indexed by
`"state"` where the `"is_metro"` column gives the **proportion of
expensive counties in each state that are part of a metropolitan area**.
For example, if New Jersey has five expensive counties and four of them
are metropolitan, the row corresponding to New Jersey should have a
value of 0.8 in the `"is_metro"` column.

    (expensive.groupby(____(a)____).max()
              .reset_index()
              .groupby(____(b)____).____(c)____)
