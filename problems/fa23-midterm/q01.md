You're interested in comparing the `"avg_housing_cost"` across
different\
`"family_type"` groups for San Diego County, CA specifically. Which type
of visualization would be most appropriate?\

( ) Scatter plot
( ) Line plot
( ) Bar chart
( ) Histogram

Suppose we run the three lines of code below.

    families = living_cost.groupby("family_type").median()
    sorted_families = families.sort_values(by="avg_housing_cost")
    result = sorted_families.get("avg_childcare_cost").iloc[0]

Which of the following does `result` evaluate to?

( ) The median `"avg_childcare_cost"` of the `"family_type"` with the
lowest median\
`"avg_housing_cost"`.
( ) The median `"avg_childcare_cost"` of the `"family_type"` with the
highest median\
`"avg_housing_cost"`.
( ) The median `"avg_housing_cost"` of the `"family_type"` with the
lowest median\
`"avg_childcare_cost"`.
( ) The median `"avg_housing_cost"` of the `"family_type"` with the
highest median\
`"avg_childcare_cost"`.

Suppose we define `another_result` as follows.

    another_result = (living_cost.groupby("state").count()
                      .sort_values(by="median_income", ascending=False)
                      .get("median_income").index[0])

What does `another_result` represent?

( ) The state with the highest median income.
( ) The median income in the state with the highest median income.
( ) The state with the most counties.
( ) The median income in the state with the most counties.

Which of the following DataFrames has exactly four columns?

( ) `living_cost.groupby("family_type").min()`
( ) `living_cost.groupby("family_type").sum()`
( ) `living_cost.groupby("family_type").count()`
( ) None of the above.

Suppose we define the Series `three_columns` to be the concatenation of
three columns of the `living_cost` DataFrame as follows.

    three_columns = (living_cost.get("state") + " " +
                     living_cost.get("county") + " " + 
                     living_cost.get("family_type"))

For example, the first element of `three_columns` is the string
`"CA San Diego County 1a2c"` (refer back to the first row of
`living_cost` provided in the data overview).

What does the following expression evaluate to?

    (living_cost.assign(geo_family=three_columns)
                .groupby("geo_family").count()
                .shape[0])

( ) $10$, the number of distinct `"family_type"` values.
( ) $50$, the number of states in the US.
( ) $500$, the number of combinations of states in the US and
`"family_type"` values.
( ) $3143$, the number of counties in the US.
( ) $31430$, the number of rows in the `living_cost` DataFrame.
