Suppose we want to assign a new column named `"family_size"` to
`living_cost` that contains the total number of people in each family,
stored as an int. We do so as follows.

    living_cost = living_cost.assign(
                  family_size=living_cost.get("family_type").apply(num_people))

Which of the following options correctly define the function
`num_people` such that the line above adds the `"family_size"` column as
desired? **Select all that apply.**

*Hint:* You can access an individual character in a string using the
position number in square brackets. For example, `"midterm"[0]`
evaluates to `"m"` and `"midterm"[1]` evaluates to `"i"`.

    # Option 1
    def num_people(fam): 
        return int(fam[0]) + int(fam[2])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 2
    def num_people(fam):
        return int(fam[0] + fam[2])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 3
    def num_people(fam):
        x = int(fam[0] + fam[2])
        return int(x / 10) + x % 10
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 4
    def num_people(fam):
        x = fam.strip("c").split("a")
        return int(x[0]) + int(x[1])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 5
    def num_people(fam):
        x = 0
        for i in fam:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                x = x + 1
        return x
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 6
    def num_people(fam):
        x = 0
        for i in np.arange(len(fam)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                x = x + int(fam[i])
        return x

**Answer:** Options 1, 3, 4, 6

Option 1: In order to get the number of people within a family, we can look at the character at position 0 (for the number of adults) and the character at position 2 (for the number of children). Converting each character string into an int and adding them up after yields the correct results.

Option 2: This is similar to option 1, however, the key difference is that the separate strings are converted into an integer afterwards. When adding two strings that are of number values, the strings will concatenate instead of adding numbers normally. So, if we were given the family type example of "1a2c", "1" and "2" will be extracted and added together where "1" + "2" = "12" instead of the value 3 that we are looking for.

Option 3: This option is similar to option 2, however, includes an extra step that takes the concatenated value and adds up the tens and ones place. `int(x/10)` gets the value in the tens, while `x % 10` gets the value in the ones. Looking at the example of "1a2c" (explained earlier that the `x = 12`), `int(12/10)` will yield 1 while `12 % 10` yields 2 and adding them together achieves 3.

Option 4: This option is similar to option 1, but includes the step of removing “c” and “a” from the string beforehand. After stripping these two characters, we are left with a 2 digit string, which are added up as separate ints in the last line.

Option 5: This option iterates through the input string, where i represents each individual character in the string. This option includes calculating the remainder when we divide by two (`i % 2`) which results in an error if done on a string.

Option 6: This is a similar approach to option 5. In this situation, i represents each character position in the string (in this case it will be an array of [0,1,2,3], since there will always be a total of 4 characters). At every character position, the code will check if the position is even (`i % 2 == 0`), which is only true for the character at position 0 and 2 (which are the positions that contain the numbers for adults and children for all family types). If it's true, we add the current position's character and add it to x.
