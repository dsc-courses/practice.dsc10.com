Suppose we want to assign a new column named `"family_size"` to
`living_cost` that contains the total number of people in each family,
stored as an int. We do so as follows.

    living_cost = living_cost.assign(
                  family_size=living_cost.get("family_type").apply(num_people))

Which of the following options correctly define the function
`num_people` such that the line above adds the `"family_size"` column as
desired? **Select all that apply.**

*Hint:* You can access an individual character in a string using the
position number in square brackets. For example, `"midterm"[0]`
evaluates to `"m"` and `"midterm"[1]` evaluates to `"i"`.

    # Option 1
    def num_people(fam): 
        return int(fam[0]) + int(fam[2])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 2
    def num_people(fam):
        return int(fam[0] + fam[2])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 3
    def num_people(fam):
        x = int(fam[0] + fam[2])
        return int(x / 10) + x % 10
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 4
    def num_people(fam):
        x = fam.strip("c").split("a")
        return int(x[0]) + int(x[1])
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 5
    def num_people(fam):
        x = 0
        for i in fam:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                x = x + 1
        return x
    ------------------------------------
    # Option 6
    def num_people(fam):
        x = 0
        for i in np.arange(len(fam)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                x = x + int(fam[i])
        return x


[ ] Option 1
[ ] Option 2
[ ] Option 3
[ ] Option 4
[ ] Option 5
[ ] Option 6
[ ] None of the above.

**Answer:** Options 1, 3, 4, 6

Option 1: In order to get the number of people within a family, we can look at the 0th index character (for the number of adults) and the 2nd index character (for the number of children). Converting each character string into an int and adding them up after yields the correct results.

Option 2: This is similar to option 1, however, the key difference is that the separate strings are converted into an integer afterwards. When adding two strings that are of number values, the strings will concatenate instead of adding numbers normally. So, “1” + “2” would be “12” instead of the value 3 that we are looking for.

Option 3: This option also has a variable ‘x’, however, includes an extra step that takes the concatenated value and adds up the tens and ones place. int(x/10) gets the value in the tens, while x % 10 gets the value in the ones.

Option 4: This option is similar to option 1, but includes the step of removing “c” and “a” from the string beforehand. After stripping these two characters, we are left with a 2 digit string, which are added up as separate ints in the last line.

Option 5: This option iterates through the input string, where i represents each individual character in the string. This option includes modding (i % 2) which results in an error if done on a string

Option 6: This is a similar approach to option 5. In this situation, i represents each index in the string (in this case it will be an array of [0,1,2,3]). At every index we add the value to variable ‘x’. This prove correct as index 0 and index 2 are both numbers we need to get the total number of people.
