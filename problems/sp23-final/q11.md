Raine is helping settle a debate between two friends on the "superior\"
season --- winter or summer. In doing so, they try to understand the
relationship between the number of sunshine hours per month in January
and the number of sunshine hours per month in July across all cities in
California in `sun`.

Raine finds the regression line that predicts the number of sunshine
hours in July ($y$) for a city given its number of sunshine hours in
January ($x$). In doing so, they find that the correlation between the
two variables is $\frac{2}{5}$.

Suppose the standard deviation of the number of sunshine hours in
January for cities in California is equal to the standard deviation of
the number of sunshine hours in July for cities in California.

Raine's hometown of Santa Clarita saw 60 more sunshine hours in January
than the average California city did. How many **more sunshine hours
than average** does the regression line predict that Santa Clarita will
have in July? Give your answer as a positive integer. *(Hint: You'll
need to use the fact that the correlation between the two variables is
$\frac{2}{5}$.)*

**Answer**: 24

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear regression, specifically the formula for predicting a value in a linearly correlated dataset. The formula we'll use is based on the standard deviations of the two variables (January and July sunshine hours), their correlation, and how many standard deviations away from the mean the specific data point (Santa Clarita's January sunshine hours) is. The general formula for a prediction in a simple linear regression is:$$\frac{\text{y} - \text{mean of y}}{\text{standard deviation of y}} = r \cdot \frac{\text{x} - \text{mean of x}}{\text{standard deviation of x}}$$

Given that the standard deviation of January and July sunshine hours are equal, we can simplifies our formula to:$$\text{y} - \text{mean of y}= r \cdot (\text{x} - \text{mean of x})$$

Since we're asked how much more sunshine Santa Clarita will have in July compared to the average, we're interested in the difference $\text{y} - \text{mean of y}$. We know that Santa Clarita had 60 more sunshine hours in January than the average, and we are given the fact that the correlation between the two variables(correlation coefficient) is $\frac{2}{5}$. 

- $\text{x} - \text{mean of x} = 60$

- $r = \frac{2}{5}$

Using the information above, we can calculate the predicted sunshine hours:$$\text{y} - \text{mean of y} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 60 = 24$$

Therefore, the regression line predicts that Santa Clarita will have 24 more sunshine hours than the average California city in July.

As we know, San Diego was particularly cloudy this May. More generally, Anthony, another California native, feels that California is getting cloudier and cloudier overall.

To imagine what the dataset may look like in a few years, Anthony subtracts 5 from the number of sunshine hours in both January and July for all California cities in the dataset —— i.e., he subtracts 5 from each $x$ value and 5 from each y value in the dataset. He then creates a regression line to use the new $xs$ to predict the new $ys$.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the slope of Anthony's new regression line?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{2}{5}$ or 0.4

To determine the slope of Anthony's new regression line, we need to understand how the modifications he made to the dataset (subtracting 5 hours from each x and y value) affect the slope. In simple linear regression, the slope of the regression line (denoted as $b$) is calculated using the formula:

$$b = r \cdot \frac{\text{standard deviation of y}}{\text{standard deviation of x}}$$

Where $r$ is the correlation coefficient between the two variables (which remains unchanged in Anthony's modifications). Since Anthony's modifications (subtracting a constant from all values) do not change the standard deviations of the datasets or their correlation coefficient, the slope of the new regression line will remain the same as that of the original regression line. Given the fact that the correlation coefficient is $\frac{2}{5}$ and the standard deviation of sunshine hours in January is equal to the standard deviation of sunshine hours in July. We can know that:$$b = r \cdot \frac{\text{standard deviation of y}}{\text{standard deviation of x}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 1 = \frac{2}{5}$$

Suppose the intercept of Raine's original regression line --- that is,
before Anthony subtracted 5 from each $x$ and each $y$ --- was 10. What
is the intercept of Anthony's new regression line?

( ) -7 
( ) -5 
( ) -3 
( ) 0 
( ) 3 
( ) 5 
( ) 7

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 7

Let's denote the original intercept as $a$ and the new intercept as $a'$. The equation for the original regression line is: $$y = bx + a$$

Where:

- y is the predicted value,

- b is the slope of the line,

- x is the independent variable (sunshine hours in January),

- a is the original intercept (which is 10).

When Anthony subtracts 5 from each x and y value, the new regression equation becomes: $$y - 5 = b \cdot (x - 5) + a'$$

Expanding and rearrange this equation, we get: $$y = bx - 5b + 5 + a'$$

Compare this new regression equation with the original equation, we can know that: $$-5b + 5 + a' = a$$

Therefore we get: $$a' = 10 + 5b -5 = 10 + 5 \cdot \frac{2}{5} - 5 = 7$$

Jasmine is trying to get as far away from Anthony as possible and has a
trip to Chicago planned after finals. Chicago is known for being very
warm and sunny in the summer but cold, rainy, and snowy in the winter.
She decides to build a regression line that uses month of the year
(where 1 is January, 2 is February, 12 is December, etc.) to predict the
number of sunshine hours in Chicago.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What would you expect to see in a residual plot of Jasmine's
regression line?

( ) A patternless cloud of points
( ) A distinctive pattern in the residual plot
( ) Heteroscedasticity (residuals that are not evenly vertically spread)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: A distinctive pattern in the residual plot

Chicago's weather is characterized by clear seasonal changes, with significantly different weather conditions in summer and winter. Therefore, the number of sunshine hours in a place like Chicago typically follows a cyclical pattern within a year, peaking during the summer months and reaching its lowest during the winter months. This cyclical, sinusoidal pattern cannot be accurately captured by a simple linear regression model.

In a linear regression model, residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should ideally be randomly distributed if the model fits the data well. However, in this case, due to the cyclical nature of the data, the residuals are likely to show a systematic pattern. For example, the model might consistently underpredict sunshine hours in summer (when they are at their peak) and overpredict in winter (when they are at their lowest), leading to a pattern in the residuals.

Hence, a distinctive pattern in the residual plot is expected due to the non-linear, seasonal nature of the relationship between the month of the year and the number of sunshine hours in Chicago.
