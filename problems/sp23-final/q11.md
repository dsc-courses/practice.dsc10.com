Raine is helping settle a debate between two friends on the "superior\"
season --- winter or summer. In doing so, they try to understand the
relationship between the number of sunshine hours per month in January
and the number of sunshine hours per month in July across all cities in
California in `sun`.

Raine finds the regression line that predicts the number of sunshine
hours in July ($y$) for a city given its number of sunshine hours in
January ($x$). In doing so, they find that the correlation between the
two variables is $\frac{2}{5}$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of these could be a scatter plot of number of sunshine
hours in July vs. number of sunshine hours in January?

Suppose the standard deviation of the number of sunshine hours in
January for cities in California is equal to the standard deviation of
the number of sunshine hours in July for cities in California.

Raine's hometown of Santa Clarita saw 40 more sunshine hours in January
than the average California city did. How many **more sunshine hours
than average** does the regression line predict that Santa Clarita will
have in July? Give your answer as a positive integer. *(Hint: You'll
need to use the fact that the correlation between the two variables is
$\frac{2}{5}$.)*

As we know, San Diego was particularly cloudy this May. More generally,
Anthony, another California native, feels that California is getting
cloudier and cloudier overall.

To imagine what the dataset may look like in a few years, Anthony
subtracts 5 from the number of sunshine hours in both January and July
for all California cities in the dataset --- i.e., he subtracts 5 from
each $x$ value and 5 from each $y$ value in the dataset. He then creates
a regression line to use the new $x$s to predict the new $y$s.

What is the slope of Anthony's new regression line?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{2}{5}$ or 0.4

Suppose the intercept of Raine's original regression line --- that is,
before Anthony subtracted 5 from each $x$ and each $y$ --- was 10. What
is the intercept of Anthony's new regression line?

( ) -7 
( ) -5 
( ) -3 
( ) 0 
( ) 3 
( ) 5 
( ) 7

Jasmine is trying to get as far away from Anthony as possible and has a
trip to Chicago planned after finals. Chicago is known for being very
warm and sunny in the summer but cold, rainy, and snowy in the winter.
She decides to build a regression line that uses month of the year
(where 1 is January, 2 is February, 12 is December, etc.) to predict the
number of sunshine hours in Chicago.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What would you expect to see in a residual plot of Jasmine's
regression line?

( ) A patternless cloud of points
( ) A distinctive pattern in the residual plot
( ) Heteroscedasticity (residuals that are not evenly vertically spread)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: A distinctive pattern in the residual plot
