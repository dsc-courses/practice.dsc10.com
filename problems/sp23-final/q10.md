Costin, a San Francisco native, will be back in San Francisco over the
summer, and is curious as to whether it is true that about $\frac{3}{4}$
of days in San Francisco are sunny.

Fast forward to the end of September: Costin counted that of the 30 days
in September, 27 were sunny in San Francisco. To test his theory, Costin
came up with two pairs of hypotheses.

Pair 1:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **not** $\frac{3}{4}$.

Pair 2:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **greater than**
    $\frac{3}{4}$.

For each test statistic below, choose whether the test statistic could
be used to test Pair 1, Pair 2, both, or neither. Assume that all days
are either sunny or cloudy, and that we cannot perform two-tailed
hypothesis tests. (If you don't know what those are, you don't need to!)

**Answer**: Pair 2

The test statistic provided is the difference between the number of sunny days and cloudy days in a sample of 30 days. Since each day is either sunny or cloudy, the number of cloudy days is just 30 - the number of sunny days. This means we can re-write our test statistic as follows:

$$\begin{align*} &\text{number of sunny days} - \text{number of cloudy days} \\ &= \text{number of sunny days} - (30 - \text{number of sunny days}) \\ &= 2 \cdot \text{number of sunny days} - 30 \\ &=
2 \cdot (\text{number of sunny days} - 15) \end{align*}$$

The more sunny days there are in our sample of 30 days, the larger this test statistic will be. (Specifically, if there are more sunny days than cloudy days, this will be positive; if there's an equal number of sunny and cloudy days, this will be 0, and if there are more cloudy days, this will be negative.)

Now, let's look at each pair of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

Pair 1's alternative hypothesis is that the probability of a sunny day is not $\frac{3}{4}$, which includes both greater than and less than $\frac{3}{4}$.

To test this pair of hypotheses, we need a test statistic that is **large** when the number of sunny days is far from $\frac{3}{4}$ (evidence for the alternative hypothesis) and **small** when the number of sunny days is close to $\frac{3}{4}$ (evidence for the null hypothesis). (It would also be acceptable to design a test statistic that is small when the number of sunny days is far from $\frac{3}{4}$ and large when it's close to $\frac{3}{4}$, but the first option we've outlined is a bit more natural.)

Our chosen test statistic, $2 \cdot (\text{number of sunny days} - 15)$, doesn't work this way; both very large values and very small values indicate that the proportion of sunny days is far from $\frac{3}{4}$, and since we can't use two-tailed tests, we can't use our test statistic for this pair.


**Pair 2**:\

Pair 2's alternative hypothesis is that the probability of a sunny day greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

Since our test statistic is large when the number of sunny days is large (evidence for the alternative hypothesis) and is small when the number of sunny days is small (evidence for the null hypothesis), we can use our test statistic to test this pair of hypotheses. The key difference between Pair 1 and Pair 2 is that Pair 2's alternative hypothesis has a direction – it says that the probability that it is sunny on any given day is **greater than** $\frac{3}{4}$, rather than just "not" $\frac{3}{4}$.

Thus, we can use this test statistic to test Pair 2, but not Pair 1.

The absolute difference between the number of sunny days and number of cloudy days

**Answer**: Neither

The test statistic here is the absolute value of the test statistic in the first part. Since we were able to re-write the test statistic in the first part as $2 \cdot (\text{number of sunny days} - 15)$, our test statistic here is $|2 \cdot (\text{number of sunny days} - 15)|$, or, since $2$ already non-negative,

$$2 \cdot | \text{number of sunny days} - 15 |$$

This test statistic is large when the number of sunny days is far from 15, i.e. when the number of sunny days and number of cloudy days are far apart, or when the proportion of sunny days is far from $\frac{1}{2}$. However, the null hypothesis we're testing here is not that the proportion of sunny days is $\frac{1}{2}$, but that the proportion of sunny days is $\frac{3}{4}$. 

A large value of this test statistic will tell us the proportion of sunny days is far from $\frac{1}{2}$, but it may or may not be far from $\frac{3}{4}$. For instance, when $\text{number of sunny days} = 7$, then our test statistic is $2 \cdot | 7 - 15 | = 16$. When $\text{number of sunny days} = 23$, our test statistic is also 16. However, in the first case, the proportion of sunny days is just under $\frac{1}{4}$ (far from $\frac{3}{4}$), while in the second case the proportion of sunny days is just above $\frac{3}{4}$.

In both pairs of hypotheses, this test statistic isn't set up such that large values point to one hypothesis and small values point to the other, so it can't be used to test either pair.

The difference between the proportion of sunny days and $\frac{1}{4}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 2

The test statistic here is the difference between the proportion of sunny days and $\frac{1}{4}$. This means if $p$ is the proportion of sunny days, the test statistic is $p - \frac{1}{4}$. **This test statistic is large when the proportion of sunny days is large and small when the proportion of sunny days is small.** (The fact that we're subtracting by $\frac{1}{4}$ doesn't change this pattern – all it does is shift both the empirical distribution of the test statistic and our observed statistic $\frac{1}{4}$ of a unit to the left on the $x$-axis.)

As such, this test statistic behaves the same as the test statistic from the first part – both test statistics are large when the number of sunny days is large (evidence for the alternative hypothesis) and small when the number of sunny days is small (evidence for the null hypothesis). This means that, like in the first part, we can use this test statistic to test Pair 2, but not Pair 1.

The absolute difference between the proportion of cloudy days and $\frac{1}{4}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 1

The test statistic here is the absolute difference between the proportion of cloudy days and $\frac{1}{4}$. Let $q$ be the proportion of cloudy days. The test statistic is $|q - \frac{1}{4}|$. The null hypothesis for both pairs states that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, which implies the probability of a cloudy day is $\frac{1}{4}$ (since all days are either sunny or cloudy).

This test statistic is large when the proportion of cloudy days is far from $\frac{1}{4}$ and small when the proportion of cloudy days is close to $\frac{1}{4}$.

Since **Pair 1**'s alternative hypothesis is just that the proportion of cloudy days is not $\frac{1}{4}$, we can use this test statistic to test it! Large values of this test statistic point to the alternative hypothesis and small values point to the null.

On the other hand, **Pair 2**'s alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of sunny days is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$, which is the same as the proportion of cloudy days being less than $\frac{1}{4}$. The issue here is that our test statistic doesn't involve a direction – a large value implies that the proportion of cloudy days is far from $\frac{1}{4}$, but we don't know if that means that there were fewer cloudy days than $\frac{1}{4}$ (evidence for Pair 2's alternative hypothesis) or more cloudy days than $\frac{1}{4}$ (evidence for Pair 2's null hypothesis). Since, for Pair 2, this test statistic isn't set up such that large values point to one hypothesis and small values point to the other, we can't use this test statistic to test Pair 2.

Therefore, we can use this test statistic to test Pair 1, but not Pair 2.

***Aside:*** This test statistic is equivalent to the absolute difference between the proportion of sunny days and $\frac{3}{4}$. Try and prove this fact!
