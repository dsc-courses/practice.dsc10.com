Costin, a San Francisco native, will be back in San Francisco over the
summer, and is curious as to whether it is true that about $\frac{3}{4}$
of days in San Francisco are sunny.

Fast forward to the end of September: Costin counted that of the 30 days
in September, 27 were sunny in San Francisco. To test his theory, Costin
came up with two pairs of hypotheses.

Pair 1:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **not** $\frac{3}{4}$.

Pair 2:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **greater than**
    $\frac{3}{4}$.

For each test statistic below, choose whether the test statistic could
be used to test Pair 1, Pair 2, both, or neither. Assume that all days
are either sunny or cloudy, and that we cannot perform two-tailed
hypothesis tests. (If you don't know what those are, you don't need to!)

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The difference between the number of sunny days and number of
cloudy days

( ) Pair 1 
( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 2

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- This statistic calculates the difference between the count of sunny days and cloudy days.

- If the number of sunny days significantly exceeds the number of cloudy days, the statistic will be large. Conversely, if there are fewer sunny days, the statistic will be smaller or even negative.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- The alternative hypothesis is that the probability of a sunny day is not $\frac{3}{4}$, which includes both greater than and less than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- If the difference between sunny and cloudy days is positive and large, it suggests a higher probability of sunny days, potentially supporting the alternative hypothesis.

- Conversely, if this difference is negative (more cloudy days than sunny), it implies a lower probability of sunny days, again potentially supporting the alternative hypothesis.

- This dual consideration (both higher and lower probabilities than $\frac{3}{4}$) makes it suitable for a two-tailed test. However, while the test statistic could theoretically suit Pair 1 under normal circumstances, the constraint of not using two-tailed tests in this question makes it inappropriate for Pair 1.

**Pair 2**:\

- Pair 2's null hypothesis posits that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that the probability is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- In this scenario, a large positive value of the test statistic (significantly more sunny days than cloudy days) would support the alternative hypothesis, indicating that sunny days are more frequent than what the null hypothesis suggests.

- Since the alternative hypothesis in Pair 2 is one-sided (only considering probabilities greater than $\frac{3}{4}$), this statistic aligns well with testing this hypothesis.

Therefore, this test statistic could be used to test pair 2, but it could not be used to test pair 1.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The absolute difference between the number of sunny days and number of cloudy days

( ) Pair 1 
( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Neither

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- This statistic calculates the absolute value of the difference between the count of sunny days and cloudy days in September. Regardless of whether there are more sunny or cloudy days, this statistic will always yield a non-negative value.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- Pair 1's null hypothesis states that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, and the alternative hypothesis is that the probability is not $\frac{3}{4}$.

- The absolute difference only indicates the magnitude of the discrepancy between sunny and cloudy days, but it doesn't indicate which is more prevalent.

- To test Pair 1 effectively, we need a statistic that can distinguish between a probability greater than or less than $\frac{3}{4}$. The absolute difference fails to provide this distinction, as it loses the directionality of the difference (whether there are more sunny days or more cloudy days).

- This inability to discern the direction of the discrepancy makes it unsuitable for a test that requires understanding whether the probability is above or below a certain threshold (as in Pair 1).

**Pair 2**:\

- Pair 2's null hypothesis is the same as in Pair 1, but the alternative hypothesis specifically suggests that the probability of a sunny day is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- The absolute difference, being non-directional, does not inform us if sunny days are more frequent than cloudy days. It only tells us how different the counts are, not which is greater.

- For Pair 2, we need a statistic that can specifically identify when sunny days are more frequent than what the null hypothesis proposes. Since the absolute difference does not provide this information, it is not suitable for testing Pair 2.

Therefore, this test statistic could not be used to test both pair 1 and pair 2.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The difference between the proportion of sunny days and $\frac{1}{4}$

( ) Pair 1 
( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 2

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- The test statistic is the difference between the proportion of sunny days and $\frac{1}{4}$.

- This means if $p$ is the proportion of sunny days, the test statistic is $p - \frac{1}{4}$.

- For both Pair 1 and Pair 2, the null hypothesis is that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$.

- Under the null hypothesis, the expected proportion of sunny days is $\frac{3}{4}$, which means the test statistic should be $\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ or 0.5.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- Pair 1's alternative hypothesis states that the probability is not $\frac{3}{4}$.

- A test statistic significantly different from 0.5 could indicate that the true proportion is either greater than or less than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- However, since the question specifies that two-tailed tests are not allowed, this test statistic can't be used for Pair 1. In a two-tailed test, we would look for significant deviations in both directions (greater than or less than 0.5), but this is not permissible here.

**Pair 2**:\

- Pair 2's alternative hypothesis states that the probability is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- If the test statistic is greater than 0.5, it suggests that the proportion of sunny days is more than $\frac{3}{4}$, aligning with Pair 2's alternative hypothesis.

- This test statistic is suitable for Pair 2 because we are only interested in one direction (greater than 0.5), making it a one-tailed test, which is permissible.

Therefore, this test statistic could not be used to test pair 1 but could be used to test pair 2.

The absolute difference between the proportion of cloudy days and $\frac{1}{4}$

( ) Pair 1 
( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 1

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- The test statistic here is the absolute difference between the proportion of cloudy days and $\frac{1}{4}$.

- Let $q$ be the proportion of cloudy days. The test statistic is $|q - \frac{1}{4}|$.

- The null hypothesis for both pairs states that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, which implies the probability of a cloudy day is $\frac{1}{4}$.

- Under the null hypothesis, $q$ (the proportion of cloudy days) should be $\frac{1}{4}$, and therefore, the test statistic $|q - \frac{1}{4}|$ should be 0.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- The alternative hypothesis in Pair 1 is that the probability of a sunny day is not $\frac{3}{4}$, implying that the probability of a cloudy day is not $\frac{1}{4}$.

- A significant deviation from 0 in our test statistic (indicating that q is not close to $\frac{1}{4}$) would suggest that the null hypothesis may be false, supporting the alternative hypothesis in Pair 1.

- This test is one-tailed as we are only interested in whether the absolute difference is significantly different from 0, regardless of whether it is higher or lower. This fits the requirement of not performing a two-tailed test.

**Pair 2**:\

- While this statistic can show a deviation from the expected proportion of cloudy days ($\frac{1}{4}$), it does not specifically indicate the direction of this deviation in terms of sunny days.

- For example, if the test statistic is significant, it could mean either Cloudy days are less than $\frac{1}{4}$ (and thus, sunny days are more than $\frac{3}{4}$), which supports Pair 2's alternative hypothesis. Or, cloudy days are more than $\frac{1}{4}$ (and thus, sunny days are less than $\frac{3}{4}$), which does not support Pair 2's alternative hypothesis.

- As a result, it cannot conclusively test whether the frequency of sunny days is specifically greater than $\frac{3}{4}$, which is essential for supporting or refuting Pair 2's alternative hypothesis.

Therefore, this test statistic could be used to test pair 1 but could not be used to test pair 2.
