# BEGIN PROB

Costin, a San Francisco native, will be back in San Francisco over the
summer, and is curious as to whether it is true that about $\frac{3}{4}$
of days in San Francisco are sunny.

Fast forward to the end of September: Costin counted that of the 30 days
in September, 27 were sunny in San Francisco. To test his theory, Costin
came up with two pairs of hypotheses.

Pair 1:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **not** $\frac{3}{4}$.

Pair 2:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any given
    day in September in San Francisco is $\frac{3}{4}$, independent of
    all other days.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The probability that it is sunny on any
    given day in September in San Francisco is **greater than**
    $\frac{3}{4}$.

For each test statistic below, choose whether the test statistic could
be used to test Pair 1, Pair 2, both, or neither. Assume that all days
are either sunny or cloudy, and that we cannot perform two-tailed
hypothesis tests. (If you don't know what those are, you don't need to!)

( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Pair 2

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- This statistic calculates the difference between the count of sunny days and cloudy days.

- If the number of sunny days significantly exceeds the number of cloudy days, the statistic will be large. Conversely, if there are fewer sunny days, the statistic will be smaller or even negative.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- The alternative hypothesis is that the probability of a sunny day is not $\frac{3}{4}$, which includes both greater than and less than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- If the difference between sunny and cloudy days is positive and large, it suggests a higher probability of sunny days, potentially supporting the alternative hypothesis.

- Conversely, if this difference is negative (more cloudy days than sunny), it implies a lower probability of sunny days, again potentially supporting the alternative hypothesis.

- This dual consideration (both higher and lower probabilities than $\frac{3}{4}$) makes it suitable for a two-tailed test. However, while the test statistic could theoretically suit Pair 1 under normal circumstances, the constraint of not using two-tailed tests in this question makes it inappropriate for Pair 1.

**Pair 2**:\

- Pair 2's null hypothesis posits that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that the probability is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- In this scenario, a large positive value of the test statistic (significantly more sunny days than cloudy days) would support the alternative hypothesis, indicating that sunny days are more frequent than what the null hypothesis suggests.

- Since the alternative hypothesis in Pair 2 is one-sided (only considering probabilities greater than $\frac{3}{4}$), this statistic aligns well with testing this hypothesis.

Therefore, this test statistic could be used to test pair 2, but it could not be used to test pair 1.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The absolute difference between the number of sunny days and number of cloudy days

( ) Pair 1 
( ) Pair 2 
( ) Both 
( ) Neither

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Neither

Let's start by understanding the test statistic:

- This statistic calculates the absolute value of the difference between the count of sunny days and cloudy days in September. Regardless of whether there are more sunny or cloudy days, this statistic will always yield a non-negative value.

Now, let's try to fit the test statistic into two pairs of hypotheses.

**Pair 1**:\

- Pair 1's null hypothesis states that the probability of a sunny day is $\frac{3}{4}$, and the alternative hypothesis is that the probability is not $\frac{3}{4}$.

- The absolute difference only indicates the magnitude of the discrepancy between sunny and cloudy days, but it doesn't indicate which is more prevalent.

- To test Pair 1 effectively, we need a statistic that can distinguish between a probability greater than or less than $\frac{3}{4}$. The absolute difference fails to provide this distinction, as it loses the directionality of the difference (whether there are more sunny days or more cloudy days).

- This inability to discern the direction of the discrepancy makes it unsuitable for a test that requires understanding whether the probability is above or below a certain threshold (as in Pair 1).

**Pair 2**:\

- Pair 2's null hypothesis is the same as in Pair 1, but the alternative hypothesis specifically suggests that the probability of a sunny day is greater than $\frac{3}{4}$.

- The absolute difference, being non-directional, does not inform us if sunny days are more frequent than cloudy days. It only tells us how different the counts are, not which is greater.

- For Pair 2, we need a statistic that can specifically identify when sunny days are more frequent than what the null hypothesis proposes. Since the absolute difference does not provide this information, it is not suitable for testing Pair 2.

Therefore, this test statistic could not be used to test both pair 1 and pair 2.
