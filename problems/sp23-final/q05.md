In some cities, the number of sunshine hours per month is relatively
consistent throughout the year. SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil is one such city; in
all months of the year, the number of sunshine hours per month is
somewhere between 139 and 173. New York City's, on the other hand,
ranges from 139 to 268.

Gina and Abel, both San Diego natives, are interested in assessing how
"consistent\" the number of sunshine hours per month in San Diego appear
to be. Specifically, they'd like to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The number of sunshine hours per month in San
    Diego is drawn from the uniform distribution,
    $\left[\frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{12}, ..., \frac{1}{12}\right]$. (In
    other words, the number of sunshine hours per month in San Diego is
    equal in all 12 months of the year.)

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The number of sunshine hours per month
    in San Diego is not drawn from the uniform distribution.

As their test statistic, Gina and Abel choose the total variation
distance. To simulate samples under the null, they will sample from a
categorical distribution with 12 categories --- January, February, and
so on, through December --- each of which have an equal probability of
being chosen.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

In order to run their hypothesis test, Gina and Abel need a way to
calculate their test statistic. Below is an incomplete implementation of
a function that computes the TVD between two arrays of length 12, each
of which represent a categorical distribution.

```py
    def calculate_tvd(dist1, dist2):
        return np.mean(np.abs(dist1 - dist2)) * ____
```

Fill in the blank so that `calculate_tvd` works as intended.

( ) `1 / 6` 
( ) `1 / 3` 
( ) `1 / 2` 
( ) `2` 
( ) `3` 
( ) `6`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `6`

The TVD is the sum of the absolute differences in proportions, divided by 2. In the code to the left of the blank, we've computed the mean of the absolute differences in proportions, which is the same as the sum of the absolute differences in proportions, divided by 12 (since `len(dist1)` is `12`). To correct the fact that we divided by 12, we multiply by 6, so that we're only dividing by 2.

<average>17</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

**Moving forward, assume that `calculate_tvd` works correctly.**

Now, complete the implementation of the function `uniform_test`, which
takes in an array `observed_counts` of length 12 containing the number
of sunshine hours each month in a city and returns the p-value for the
hypothesis test stated at the start of the question.

```py
    def uniform_test(observed_counts):
        # The values in observed_counts are counts, not proportions!
        total_count = observed_counts.sum()
        uniform_dist = __(b)__
        tvds = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            simulated = __(c)__
            tvd = calculate_tvd(simulated, __(d)__)
            tvds = np.append(tvds, tvd)
        return np.mean(tvds __(e)__ calculate_tvd(uniform_dist, __(f)__))
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (b)? *(Hint: The function `np.ones(k)` returns an
array of length `k` in which all elements are `1`.)*

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `np.ones(12) / 12`

`uniform_dist` needs to be the same as the uniform distribution provided in the null hypothesis, $\left[\frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{12}, ..., \frac{1}{12}\right]$. 

In code, this is an array of length 12 in which each element is equal to $1 / 12$. `np.ones(12)` creates an array of length 12 in which each value is `1`; for each value to be `1 / 12`, we divide `np.ones(12)` by `12`.

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist)`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist) / 12`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist) / total_count`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist)`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / 12`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / total_count`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / total_count`

The idea here is to repeatedly generate an array of proportions that results from distributing `total_count` hours across the 12 months in a way that each month is equally likely to be chosen. Each time we generate such an array, we'll determine its TVD from the uniform distribution; doing this repeatedly gives us an empirical distribution of the TVD under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.

What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `uniform_dist`

What goes in blank (e)?

( ) `>`
( ) `>=` 
( ) `<` 
( ) `<=` 
( ) `==` 
( ) `!=`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `>=`

The purpose of the last line of code is to compute the p-value for the hypothesis test. Recall, the p-value of a hypothesis test is the proportion of simulated test statistics that are as or more extreme than the observed test statistic, under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this context, "as extreme or more extreme" means the simulated TVD is **greater than or equal to** the observed TVD (since larger TVDs mean "more different").

<average>77</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (f)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `observed_counts / total_count` or `observed_counts / observed_counts.sum()`

Blank (f) needs to contain the observed distribution of sunshine hours (as an array of proportions) that we compare against the uniform distribution to calculate the observed TVD. This observed TVD is then compared with the distribution of simulated TVDs to calculate the p-value. The observed counts are converted to proportions by dividing by the total count so that the observed distribution is on the same scale as the simulated and expected uniform distributions, which are also in proportions.
