In some cities, the number of sunshine hours per month is relatively
consistent throughout the year. SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil is one such city; in
all months of the year, the number of sunshine hours per month is
somewhere between 139 and 173. New York City's, on the other hand,
ranges from 139 to 268.

Gina and Abel, both San Diego natives, are interested in assessing how
"consistent\" the number of sunshine hours per month in San Diego appear
to be. Specifically, they'd like to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The number of sunshine hours per month in San
    Diego is drawn from the uniform distribution,
    $\left[\frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{12}, ..., \frac{1}{12}\right]$. (In
    other words, the number of sunshine hours per month in San Diego is
    equal in all 12 months of the year.)

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The number of sunshine hours per month
    in San Diego is not drawn from the uniform distribution.

As their test statistic, Gina and Abel choose the total variation
distance. To simulate samples under the null, they will sample from a
categorical distribution with 12 categories --- January, February, and
so on, through December --- each of which have an equal probability of
being chosen.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

In order to run their hypothesis test, Gina and Abel need a way to
calculate their test statistic. Below is an incomplete implementation of
a function that computes the TVD between two arrays of length 12, each
of which represent a categorical distribution.

```py
    def calculate_tvd(dist1, dist2):
        return np.mean(np.abs(dist1 - dist2)) * ____
```

Fill in the blank so that `calculate_tvd` works as intended.

( ) `1 / 6` 
( ) `1 / 3` 
( ) `1 / 2` 
( ) `2` 
( ) `3` 
( ) `6`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `6`

The TVD is the sum of the absolute differences in proportions, divided by 2. In the code to the left of the blank, we've computed the mean of the absolute differences in proportions, which is the same as the sum of the absolute differences in proportions, divided by 12. To correct the fact that we divided by 12, we multiply by 6, so that we're only dividing by 2.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

**Moving forward, assume that `calculate_tvd` works correctly.**

Now, complete the implementation of the function `uniform_test`, which
takes in an array `observed_counts` of length 12 containing the number
of sunshine hours each month in a city and returns the p-value for the
hypothesis test stated at the start of the question.

```py
    def uniform_test(observed_counts):
        # The values in observed_counts are counts, not proportions!
        total_count = observed_counts.sum()
        uniform_dist = __(b)__
        tvds = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            simulated = __(c)__
            tvd = calculate_tvd(simulated, __(d)__)
            tvds = np.append(tvds, tvd)
        return np.mean(tvds __(e)__ calculate_tvd(uniform_dist, __(f)__))
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (b)? *(Hint: The function `np.ones(k)` returns an
array of length `k` in which all elements are `1`.)*

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `np.ones(12) / 12`

To represent a uniform distribution of sunshine hours across the 12 months, we need an array where each entry is the same and sums to 1 (because we are working with probabilities). Since there are 12 months, each month should have an equal chance of $\frac{1}{12}$.

The `np.ones()` function can create an array filled with the value 1. To get a uniform distribution, we divide this array by 12 to represent the equal probability for each month.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist)`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist) / 12`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(12, uniform_dist) / total_count`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist)`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / 12`
( ) `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / total_count`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `np.random.multinomial(total_count, uniform_dist) / total_count`

This line of code uses the `np.random.multinomial` function to simulate the allocation of `total_count` sunshine hours (the total observed count across all months) into the 12 months based on a uniform distribution, where each month has an equal probability of being chosen. By dividing the resulting counts by `total_count`, we convert these simulated counts into proportions. These proportions are necessary because the TVD is calculated using proportions, allowing for a direct comparison between the observed proportions and the simulated proportions under the null hypothesis.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `uniform_dist`

Each simulation generates a distribution that mimics what we would expect to see if the null hypothesis were true (if the actual distribution of sunshine hours was uniform across all months). The `calculate_tvd()` function is then used to calculate how much the simulated distribution deviates from the expected uniform distribution. By doing so, we measure the divergence of each simulation from perfect uniformity.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (e)?

( ) `>`
( ) `>=` 
( ) `<` 
( ) `<=` 
( ) `==` 
( ) `!=`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `>=`

The purpose of the last line of code is to compute the p-value for the hypothesis test. The p-value is calculated by comparing the observed test statistic to the distribution of test statistics obtained under the null hypothesis. Specifically, it measures the proportion of simulated test statistics that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic. In this context, "as extreme or more extreme" means the simulated TVD is greater than or equal to the observed TVD. The `>=` operator is used to count how many of the simulated TVDs meet this criterion.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (f)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `observed_counts / total_count` or `observed_counts / observed_counts.sum()`

Blank (f) provides the observed distribution of sunshine hours (in proportions) that we compare against the uniform distribution to calculate the observed TVD. This observed TVD is then compared with the distribution of simulated TVDs to calculate the p-value. The observed counts are converted to proportions by dividing by the total count so that the observed distribution is on the same scale as the simulated and expected uniform distributions, which are also in proportions.

The p-value is the probability, under the null hypothesis, of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed. By calculating the mean of the condition `tvds >= calculate_tvd(uniform_dist, observed_counts / total_count)`, we find the proportion of simulations where the simulated TVD is greater than or equal to the observed TVD, which gives us the p-value.
