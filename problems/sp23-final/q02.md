Vanessa is a big Formula 1 racing fan, and wants to plan a trip to
Monaco, where the Monaco Grand Prix is held. Monaco is an example of a
"city-state" --- that is, a city that is its own country. Singapore is
another example of a city-state.

We'll say that a row of `sun` corresponds to a city-state if its
`"Country"` and `"City"` values are equal.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below is equal to the total
number of sunshine hours in October of all city-states in `sun`.

```py
    sun[__(a)__].__(b)__
```

What goes in blanks (a) and (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: (a):  `sun.get("Country") == sun.get("City")`, (b): `.get("Oct").sum()`

**What goes in blank (a)?** `sun.get("Country") == sun.get("City")`\
This expression compares the `"Country"` column to the `"City"` column for each row in the `sun` DataFrame. It returns a Boolean Series where each value is `True` if the corresponding `"Country"` and `"City"` are the same (indicating a city-state) and `False` otherwise.

<average>79</average>

<br><br>

**What goes in blank (b)?** `.get("Oct").sum()`\
Here, we select the `"Oct"` column, which represents the sunshine hours in October, and compute the sum of its values. By using this after querying for city-states, we calculate the total sunshine hours in October across all city-states in the `sun` DataFrame.

<average>85</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that the expression below is also equal to
the total number of sunshine hours in October of all city-states in
`sun`.

*Note: What goes in blank (b) is the same as what goes in blank (b)
above.*

```py
sun.get(["Country"]).merge(__(c)__).__(b)__
```

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `sun, left_on="Country", right_on="City"`\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.get(["Country"])`: This extracts just the `"Country"` column from the `sun` DataFrame, as a DataFrame. (It's extracted as a DataFrame since we passed a list to `.get` instead of a single string.)

- `.merge(sun, left_on="Country", right_on="City")`: Here, we're using the `.merge` method to merge a version of `sun` with just the `"Country"` column (which is our _left_ DataFrame) with the entire `sun` DataFrame (which is our _right_ DataFrame). The merge is done by matching `"Country"`s from the left DataFrame with `"City"`s from the right DataFrame. This way, rows in the resulting DataFrame correspond to city-states, as it only contains entries where a country's name is the same as a city's name.

- `.get("Oct").sum()`: After merging, we use `.get("Oct")` to retrieve the `"Oct"` column, which represents the sunshine hours in October. Finally, `.sum()` computes the total number of sunshine hours in October for all the identified city-states.
