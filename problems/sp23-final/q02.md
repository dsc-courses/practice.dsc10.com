Vanessa is a big Formula 1 racing fan, and wants to plan a trip to
Monaco, where the Monaco Grand Prix is held. Monaco is an example of a
"city-state" --- that is, a city that is its own country. Singapore is
another example of a city-state.

We'll say that a row of `sun` corresponds to a city-state if its
`"Country"` and `"City"` values are equal.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that the expression below is equal to the total
number of sunshine hours in October of all city-states in `sun`.

```py
    sun[__(a)__].__(b)__
```

What goes in blank (a)?


What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:\

**What goes in blank (a)?** `sun.get("Country") == sun.get("City")`

**What goes in blank (b)?** `.get("Oct").sum()`

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that the expression below is also equal to
the total number of sunshine hours in October of all city-states in
`sun`.

*Note: What goes in blank (b) is the same as what goes in blank (b)
above.*

```py
    sun.get(["Country"]).merge(__(c)__).__(b)__
```

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `sun, left_on = "Country", right_on = "City"`

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
