Vanessa is a big Formula 1 racing fan, and wants to plan a trip to
Monaco, where the Monaco Grand Prix is held. Monaco is an example of a
"city-state\" --- that is, a city that is its own country. Singapore is
another example of a city-state.

We'll say that a row of `sun` corresponds to a city-state if its
`"Country"` and `"City"` values are equal.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

number of sunshine hours in October of all city-states in `sun`.
