This summer, Zoe wants to explore parts of the United States that she
hasn't been to yet. In her process of figuring out where to go, she
creates a histogram depicting the distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July across all cities in the United States in `sun`.

Suppose `usa` is a DataFrame with all of the columns in `sun` but with
only the rows where `"Country"` is `"United States"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the value of `mystery` below?

```py
    cond = (usa.get("Jul") >= 370) & (usa.get("Jul") < 430)
    mystery = 100 * np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]
```

( ) `2` 
( ) `8` 
( ) `12` 
( ) `16` 
( ) `18` 
( ) `20`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `12`

`cond` is a Series that contains `True` for each row in `usa` where `"Jul"` is greater than or equal to 370 and less than 430. `mystery`, then, is the **percentage** of values in `usa` in which `cond` is True. This is because `np.count_nonzero(cond)` is the number of `True`s in `cond`, `np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]` is the proportion of values in `cond` that are `True`, and `100 * np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]` is the percentage of values in `cond` that are `True`. **Our goal here, then, is to use the histogram to find the percentage of values in the histogram between 370 (inclusive) and 430 (exclusive).**

We know that in histograms, the area of each bar is equal to the proportion of data points that fall within its bin's range. Conveniently, there's only one bar we need to look at – the one corresponding to the bin [370, 430). That bar has a width of $430 - 370 = 60$ and a height of 0.002. Then, the area of that bar – i.e. the proportion of values that are between 370 (inclusive) and 430 (exclusive) is:

$$\text{proportion} = \text{area} = \text{height} \cdot \text{width} = 0.002 \cdot 60 = 0.12$$

This means that the proportion of values in [370, 430) is 0.12, which means that the percentage of values in [370, 430) is 12\%, and that `mystery` evaluates to `12`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

There are 5 more cities with between 370 and 430 sunshine hours in July
than there are cities with between 270 and 290 sunshine hours in July.

How many cities in the United States are in `sun`? Give your answer as a
positive integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 (that is, your
answer should end in a 0).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 250

In the previous part, we learned that the proportion of cities in the `usa` DataFrame in the interval [370, 430) (i.e. that have between 370 and 430 sunshine hours in July) is 0.12. To use the fact that there are 5 more cities in the interval [370, 430) than there are in the interval [270, 290), we need to first find the proportion of cities in the interval [270, 290). To do so, we look at the [270, 290) bin, which has a width of $290 - 270 = 20$ and a height of 0.005:

$\text{proportion} = 0.005 \cdot 20 = 0.10$

We are told that there are 5 more cities in the [370, 430) interval than there are in the [270, 290) interval. Given the proportions we've computed, we have that:

$\text{difference in proportions} = 0.12 - 0.1 = 0.02$

If $0.02 \cdot \text{number of cities}$ is 5, then $\text{number of cities} = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{0.02} = 5 \cdot 50 = 250$.

Now, suppose we convert the number of sunshine hours in July for all
cities in the United States (i.e., "US cities") in `sun` from their
original units (hours) to standard units.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $m$ be the mean number of sunshine hours in July for all
US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement below.

( ) $m = -1$
( ) $-1 < m < 0$
( ) $m = 0$
( ) $0 < m < 1$
( ) $m = 1$
( ) $m > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $m = 0$\

When we standardize a dataset, the mean of the resulting values is always 0 and the standard deviation of the resulting values is always 1. This tells us right away that the answer is $m = 0$. Intuitively, we know that a value in standard units represents the number of standard deviations that value is above or below the mean of the column it came from. $m$ is equal to the mean of the column it came from, so $m$ in standard units is 0.

If we'd like to approach this more algebracically, we can remember the formula for converting a value $x_i$ from a column $x$ to standard units:

$$ x_{i \: \text{(su)}} = \frac{x_i - \text{mean of } x}{\text{SD of } x} $$

Let $x$ be the column (i.e. Series) containing the mean number of sunshine hours in July for all US cities in `sun`. $m$, by definition, is the mean of $x$. Then, 

$$ m_{\text{(su)}} = \frac{m - \text{mean of } x}{\text{SD of } x} = \frac{m - m}{\text{SD of }x} = 0$$

Given that $m$ is the mean of column $x$, the numerator of $m_\text{(su)}$ is 0, and hence $m_\text{(su)}$ is 0.

<average>62</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $s$ be the standard deviation of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities `sun`, in standard units. Select the
true statement below.

( ) $s = -1$
( ) $-1 < s <0$
( ) $s = 0$
( ) $0 < s < 1$
( ) $s = 1$
( ) $s > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $s = 1$\

As mentioned in the previous solution, when we standardize a dataset, the mean of the resulting values is always 0 and the standard deviation of the resulting values is always 1.

<average>46</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $d$ be the median of the number of sunshine hours in July
for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement
below.

( ) $d = -1$
( ) $-1 < d < 0$
( ) $d = 0$       
( ) $0 < d < 1$
( ) $d = 1$
( ) $d > 1$    

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $-1 < d < 0$\

In the histogram, we see that the distribution of the number of sunshine hours in July for all US cities in `sun`is skewed right, or has a right tail. This means that this distribution's mean is dragged in the direction of its tail and is larger than its median. Since the mean in standard units is 0, and the median is less than the mean, the median in standard units must be negative. There's no property that states that the median is exactly -1, and the median is only slightly less than the mean, which means that it must be the case that $-1 < d < 0$.

<average>42</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units, is roughly
normal.

( ) True 
( ) False 
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False\

The original histogram depicting the distribution of the number of sunshine hours in July for all US cities is right-skewed. When data is converted to standard units, the shape of the distribution does not change. Therefore, if the original data is right-skewed, the standardized data will also be right-skewed.
