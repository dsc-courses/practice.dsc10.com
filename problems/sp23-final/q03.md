This summer, Zoe wants to explore parts of the United States that she
hasn't been to yet. In her process of figuring out where to go, she
creates a histogram depicting the distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July across all cities in the United States in `sun`.

Suppose `usa` is a DataFrame with all of the columns in `sun` but with
only the rows where `"Country"` is `"United States"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the value of `mystery` below?

```py
    cond = (usa.get("Jul") >= 370) & (usa.get("Jul") < 430)
    mystery = 100 * np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]
```

( ) `2` 
( ) `8` 
( ) `12` 
( ) `16` 
( ) `18` 
( ) `20`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 12\

We know that the area of each bin in the histogram represents the proportion of the data that falls within that bin's range. In this case, we are looking for the bins 370-390, 390-410, and 410-430. Each bin has a width of 20 and their respective heights are given as 0.002. To find out what proportion of the data falls within a specific bin, you multiply the height of the bin by its width. For each of these bins:

$\text{proportion} = \text{height} \cdot \text{width}$\
$\text{proportion} = 0.002 \cdot 20 = 0.04$

This indicates that 4% (or 0.04 as a proportion) of the data falls within each of these bins. And the computed proportion (4%) represents the fraction of U.S. cities in the `usa` DataFrame that have sunshine hours within each bin's range. Since there are three bins in the range of 370 to 430, and each has 4% of the cities, the total percentage of cities with sunshine hours between 370 and 430 is:

$\text{total precentage} = 3 \cdot 4\% = 12\%$

Now let's look at the code:

- `cond = (usa.get("Jul") >= 370) & (usa.get("Jul") < 430)`: This line of code creates a Boolean condition that checks which cities in the `usa` DataFrame have sunshine hours in July between 370 and 430.

- `mystery = 100 * np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]`: This line of code calculates the percentage of cities satisfying the condition. `np.count_nonzero(cond)` counts the number of cities with sunshine hours in the specified range. Dividing this count by the total number of cities in `usa` (`usa.shape[0]`) gives the proportion, which is then multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.

By interpreting the histogram and using the code provided, we can conclude that both methods are achieving the same goal: determining that 12% of the cities in the `usa` DataFrame have sunshine hours in July between 370 and 430.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

There are 5 more cities with between 370 and 430 sunshine hours in July
than there are cities with between 270 and 290 sunshine hours in July.

How many cities in the United States are in `sun`? Give your answer as a
positive integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 (that is, your
answer should end in a 0).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 250\

We get the proportion of cities (12%) in the `usa` DataFrame that have sunshine hours in July between 370 and 430 from the previous part. Now, we have to compute the proportion of cities in the `usa` DataFrame that have sunshine hours in July between 270 and 290.

$0.005 \cdot 20 = 0.10$ $\text{or}$ $10\%$ $\text{of cities}$

We are told that there are 5 more cities in the 370-430 sunshine hours range than there are in the 270-290 sunshine hours range. Given the percentages we computed above:

$\text{Difference in percentages} = 12\% - 10\% = 2\%$

If 2% represents 5 cities, then 100% (which represents the total number of cities in the `usa` DataFrame) represents $5 \cdot \frac{100}{2} = 250$ cities.

Now, suppose we convert the number of sunshine hours in July for all
cities in the United States (i.e., "US cities") in `sun` from their
original units (hours) to standard units.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $m$ be the mean number of sunshine hours in July for all
US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement below.


( ) $m = -1$
( ) $-1 < m < 0$
( ) $m = 0$
( ) $0 < m < 1$
( ) $m = 1$
( ) $m > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $m = 0$\

When converting data to standard units, each data point is transformed using the formula:

$$ z = \frac{x - \text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}} $$

For the mean value $m$ of the data, the transformation becomes:

$$ m_{\text{standard units}} = \frac{m - \text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}} $$

Given that $m$ itself is the mean of the original data, the difference $m$ - mean equals zero.

So, the transformed value of the mean becomes:

$$ m_{\text{standard units}} = \frac{0}{\text{standard deviation}} = 0 $$

Thus, the mean $m$ of the data after converting to standard units will always be 0.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $s$ be the standard deviation of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities `sun`, in standard units. Select the
true statement below.


( ) $s = -1$
( ) $-1 < s <0$
( ) $s = 0$
( ) $0 < s < 1$
( ) $s = 1$
( ) $s > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $s = 1$\

The standard deviation of a dataset after converting it to standard units is always 1.

<average>46</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $d$ be the median of the number of sunshine hours in July
for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement
below.


( ) $d = -1$
( ) $-1 < d < 0$
( ) $d = 0$       
( ) $0 < d < 1$
( ) $d = 1$
( ) $d > 1$    

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $-1 < d < 0$\

We see that the distribution of the histogram is skewed right, or has a right tail, which means the mean is dragged in the direction of the tail and is larger than the median. Since the mean in standard units is 0, and the median is less than the mean, the median in standard units must be negative. There's no property that states that the median is exactly -1, and the median is only slightly less than the mean, ruling out $d = -1$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units, is roughly
normal.

( ) True 
( ) False 
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False\

The original histogram depicting the distribution of the number of sunshine hours in July for all US cities is right-skewed. When data is converted to standard units, the shape of the distribution does not change. The process of standardizing does not alter the skewness or the kurtosis of the distribution. Therefore, if the original data is right-skewed, the standardized data will also be right-skewed.
