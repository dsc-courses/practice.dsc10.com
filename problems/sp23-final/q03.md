This summer, Zoe wants to explore parts of the United States that she
hasn't been to yet. In her process of figuring out where to go, she
creates a histogram depicting the distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July across all cities in the United States in `sun`.

Suppose `usa` is a DataFrame with all of the columns in `sun` but with
only the rows where `"Country"` is `"United States"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the value of `mystery` below?

```py
    cond = (usa.get("Jul") >= 370) & (usa.get("Jul") < 430)
    mystery = 100 * np.count_nonzero(cond) / usa.shape[0]
```

( ) `2` 
( ) `8` 
( ) `12` 
( ) `16` 
( ) `18` 
( ) `20`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 12

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

There are 5 more cities with between 370 and 430 sunshine hours in July
than there are cities with between 270 and 290 sunshine hours in July.

How many cities in the United States are in `sun`? Give your answer as a
positive integer, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 (that is, your
answer should end in a 0).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 250

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Now, suppose we convert the number of sunshine hours in July for all
cities in the United States (i.e., "US cities") in `sun` from their
original units (hours) to standard units.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $m$ be the mean number of sunshine hours in July for all
US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement below.


( ) $m = -1$
( ) $-1 < m < 0$
( ) $m = 0$
( ) $0 < m < 1$
( ) $m = 1$
( ) $m > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $m = 0$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $s$ be the standard deviation of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities `sun`, in standard units. Select the
true statement below.


( ) $s = -1$
( ) $-1 < s <0$
( ) $s = 0$
( ) $0 < s < 1$
( ) $s = 1$
( ) $s > 1$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $s = 1$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $d$ be the median of the number of sunshine hours in July
for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units. Select the true statement
below.


( ) $d = -1$
( ) $-1 < d < 0$
( ) $d = 0$       
( ) $0 < d < 1$
( ) $d = 1$
( ) $d > 1$    

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $-1 < d < 0$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The distribution of the number of sunshine
hours in July for all US cities in `sun`, in standard units, is roughly
normal.

( ) True 
( ) False 
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
