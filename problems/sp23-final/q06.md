Oren's favorite bakery in San Diego is Wayfarer. After visiting
frequently, he decides to learn how to make croissants and baguettes
himself, and to do so, he books a trip to France.

Oren is interested in estimating the mean number of sunshine hours in
July across all 10,000+ cities in France. Using the 16 French cities in
`sun`, Oren constructs a 95% Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-based
confidence interval for the mean sunshine hours of all cities in France.
The interval is of the form $[L, R]$, where $L$ and $R$ are positive
numbers.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following expressions is equal to the standard deviation of
the number of sunshine hours of the 16 French cities in `sun`?

( ) $R - L$ 
( ) $\frac{R - L}{2}$ 
( ) $\frac{R - L}{4}$ 
( ) $R + L$ 
( ) $\frac{R + L}{2}$ 
( ) $\frac{R + L}{4}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $R - L$

Note that the 95\% CI is of the form of the following:

$$[\text{Sample Mean} - 2 \cdot SD_{\text{Sample Mean's Distribution}}, \text{Sample Mean} + 2 \cdot SD_{\text{Sample Mean's Distribution}}]$$

This making its width $4 \cdot SD_{\text{Sample Mean's Distribution}}$. Note that our sample size is 16, we can rewrite the width as the following equation:

$$4 \cdot SD_{\text{Sample Mean's Distribution}} = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Population SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}\right) \approx 4 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample Size}}}\right) = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{4}\right)$$

From the above equation, we can know that $4 \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Sample SD}}{4}\right) = {\text{Sample SD}}$, so the width of our confidence interval, $R - L$, is equal to the SD of our sample.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: There is a 95% chance that the interval
$[L, R]$ contains the mean number of sunshine hours in July of all 16
French cities in `sun`.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

$[L, R]$contains the sample mean for sure, since it is centered at the sample mean. There is no probability associated with this fact.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: If we collected 1,000 new samples of 16 French
cities and computed the mean of each sample, then about 95% of the new
sample means would be contained in $[L, R]$.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

It is true that if we collected many samples and used each one to make a 95% confidence interval, about 95% of those confidence intervals would contain the population mean. However, that's not what this question is asking about. Instead it's asking about the one interval we created in particular, $[L,R]$. It's possible that the sample that we used to create $[L,R]$ was not a representative sample, and so there's no guarantee of the proportion of means of other samples that would fall in $[L,R]$.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: If we collected 1,000 new samples of 16 French
cities and created a 95% confidence interval using each one, then chose
one of the 1,000 new intervals at random, the chance that the randomly
chosen interval contains the mean sunshine hours in July across all
cities in France is approximately 95%.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: True

It is true that if we collected many samples and used each one to make a 95% confidence interval, about 95% of those confidence intervals would contain the population mean, as we said in the answer to the above question. So, if we picked one of those confidence intervals at random, there's an approximately 95% chance it would contain the population mean.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The interval $[L, R]$ is centered at the mean
number of sunshine hours in July across all cities in France.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

It is centered at our sample mean, which is the mean sunshine hours in July across all cities in France in `sun`, but not necessarily at the population mean.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

In addition to creating a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the mean
sunshine hours of all cities in France, Oren would like to create a 72%
bootstrap-based confidence interval for the mean sunshine hours of all
cities in France.

Oren resamples from the 16 French sunshine hours in `sun` 10,000 times
and creates an array named `french_sunshine` containing 10,000 resampled
means. He wants to find the left and right endpoints of his 72%
confidence interval:

```py
    boot_left = np.percentile(french_sunshine, __(a)__)
    boot_right = np.percentile(french_sunshine, __(b)__)
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks so that `boot_left` and `boot_right` evaluate to the
left and right endpoints of a 72% confidence interval for the mean
sunshine hours in July across all cities in France.

What goes in blank (a)?

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

What goes in blank (a)? 14

What goes in blank (b)? 86

For a 72% confidence interval, we are trying to excludes 28% of the data, which means 14% in each tail. So blank (a) will be just 14 and blank (b) will be $100 - 14 = 86$.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Suppose we are interested in testing the following pair of hypotheses.

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The mean number of sunshine hours of all cities
    in France in July is equal to 225.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The mean number of sunshine hours of all
    cities in France in July is not equal to 225.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that when Oren uses `[boot_left, boot_right]`, his 72%
bootstrap-based confidence interval, he fails to reject the null
hypothesis above. If that's the case, then when using $[L, R]$, his 95%
CLT-based confidence interval, what is the conclusion of his hypothesis
test?

( ) Reject the null 
( ) Fail to reject the null 
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Impossible to tell

First, remember that we fail to reject the null whenever the parameter stated in the null hypothesis(225 in this case) is in the interval. So we're told 225 is in the 72% bootstrapped interval. There's a possibility that the 72% bootstrapped confidence interval isn't completely contained within the 95% CLT interval, since the specific interval we get back with bootstrapping depends on the random resamples we get. What that means is that it's possible for 225 to be in the 72% bootstrapped interval but not the 95% CLT interval, and it's also possible for it to be in the 95% CLT interval. Therefore, given no other information it's impossible to tell.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that Oren also creates a 72% CLT-based confidence
interval for the mean sunshine hours of all cities in France in July
using the same 16 French cities in `sun` he started with. When using his
72% CLT-based confidence interval, he fails to reject the null
hypothesis above. If that's the case, then when using $[L, R]$, what is
the conclusion of his hypothesis test?

( ) Reject the null 
( ) Fail to reject the null 
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Fail to reject the null

If 225 is in the 72% CLT interval, it must be in the 95% CLT interval, since the two intervals are centered at the same location and the 95% interval is just wider than the 72% interval. The main difference between this part and the previous one is the fact that this 72% interval was made with the CLT, not via bootstrapping, even though they're likely to be similar.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: The significance levels of both hypothesis tests
described in part (h) are equal.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

When using a 72% confidence interval, the significance level, i.e. p-value cutoff, is 28%. When using a 95% confidence interval, the significance level is 5%.
