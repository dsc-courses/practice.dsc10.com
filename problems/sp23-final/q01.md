Complete the implementation of the function `most_sunshine`, which takes
in `country`, the name of a country, and `month`, the name of a month
(e.g. `"Apr"`), and returns the name of the city (as a string) in
`country` with the most sunshine hours in `month`, among the cities in
`sun`. Assume there are no ties.

```py  
    def most_sunshine(country, month):
        country_only = __(a)__
        return country_only.__(b)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:\

**What goes in blank (a)?** `sun[sun.get("Country") == country]`\
To identify cities only within the specified country, we need to filter the rows in the `sun` DataFrame where the `"Country"` column matches the given `country`. The expression `sun["Country"] == country` creates a boolean series, where each entry is `True` if the corresponding row's `"Country"` column matches the provided `country` and `False` otherwise. When this boolean series is used to index the `sun` DataFrame, it filters out only those rows that are true, effectively giving us only the cities from the specified country.

**What goes in blank (b)?** `sort_values(month).get("City").iloc[-1]` or `sort_values(month, ascending=False).get("City").iloc[0]`\
To determine the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month, we sort the filtered DataFrame (which only contains cities from the specified country) based on the values in the `month` column. There are two ways to achieve the desired result:

- Sort in ascending order and then select the last item. This is because after sorting in ascending order, the city with the highest sunshine hours will be the last item. We use `.iloc[-1]` to get the last item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.

- Sort in descending order and then select the first item. After sorting in descending order, the city with the highest sunshine hours will be the first item. We use `.iloc[0]` to get the first item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.

Both methods will give us the name of the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:\
Let's start by understanding the code provided in the question:\
The `.groupby("City")` method groups the data in the `sun` DataFrame by unique city names. Since every city name in the DataFrame is unique, this essentially means that each group will consist of just one row corresponding to that city.

After grouping by city, the `.mean()` method computes the average of each column for each group. Again, as each city name is unique, this operation doesn't aggregate multiple rows but merely reproduces the original values for each city.

Finally, `.reset_index()` is used to reset the DataFrame's index. When using `.groupby()`, the column we group by (in this case, `"City"`) becomes the index. By resetting the index, we're making `"City"` a regular column again and adding a new integer index to the DataFrame.

**What goes in blank (c)?** `"City"`\
In the code, we grouped by `"City"`, and since all city names are unique, this operation effectively sorts the DataFrame by city names. To replicate the order in the resultant `cities` DataFrame, we must sort `sun` by the `"City"` column.

<average>97</average>
<br><br>

**What goes in blank (d)?** ascending\
The `.groupby("City")` operation inherently sorts the `"City"` column in ascending order. To ensure our DataFrame aligns with the order of the `cities` DataFrame after the grouping operation, we need to sort the `"City"` column in ascending order.

<average>77</average>
<br><br>

**What goes in blank (e)?** , drop the `"Country"` column, and reset the index\
In the code, after grouping by `"City"` and computing the mean, we reset the index. This means the `"City"` column is no longer the index but a regular column, and the DataFrame gets a fresh integer index. To replicate this structure, we need to reset the index in our sorted DataFrame. Additionally, when we applied the `.mean()` method after grouping, any non-numeric columns (like `"Country"`) that don't have a meaningful average are automatically excluded from the resulting DataFrame. Thus, the `"Country"` column is not present in the `cities` DataFrame because it doesn't have a numerical mean. To match the structure of `cities`, we must drop the `"Country"` column from our sorted DataFrame.

True or False: In the code below, `Z` is guaranteed to evaluate to
`True`.

```py
    x = sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean().shape[0]
    y = sun.groupby("Country").mean().shape[0]
    z = (x >= y)
```

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: True\
Let's us look at each line of code separately:

- `x = sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean().shape[0]`: This line groups the `sun` DataFrame by both `"Country"` and `"Year"`, then computes the mean. As a result, each unique combination of `"Country"` and `"Year"` will have its own row. For instance, if there are three years of data for a particular country, that will result in three rows for that country in this grouping.

- `y = sun.groupby("Country").mean().shape[0]`: When grouping by `"Country"` alone, each unique country in the `sun` DataFrame is represented by one row, regardless of the number of years of data associated with that country.

- `z = (x >= y)`: This comparison checks whether the number of rows produced by grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` (which is `x`) is greater than or equal to the number of rows produced by grouping only by `"Country"` (which is `y`).

Given our grouping logic:

- If every country in the `sun` DataFrame has data for only a single year, then the number of rows when grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` will be equal to the number of rows when grouping by `"Country"` alone. In this scenario, `x` will be equal to `y`.

- If at least one country in the `sun` DataFrame has data for more than one year, then there will be more rows when grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` compared to grouping by `"Country"` alone. This means `x` will be greater than `y`.

Considering the above scenarios, there's no situation where the value of `x` can be less than the value of `y`. Therefore, `z` will always evaluate to `True`.

( ) C 
( ) D 
( ) E 
( ) F 
( ) G

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: E. The last city, alphabetically, in the first country, alphabetically.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").max()`: This line of code groups the `sun` DataFrame by the `"Country"` column and then determines the **maximum** for each column within each country group. For the `"City"` column, this means finding the city that comes last when arranged in alphabetical order.

- `.get("City")`: After grouping and determining the maximums, `.get("City")` retrieves the `"City"` column. 

- `.iloc[0]`: Finally, `.iloc[0]` selects the value of the city from the first row, which corresponds to the first country alphabetically due to the inherent sorting behavior of the groupby operation.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: G. Nothing, because it errors.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").sum()`: This groups the `sun` DataFrame by the `"Country"` column and computes the sum for each numeric column within each country group. Since `"City"` is non-numeric, it will be dropped.

- `.get("City")`: This operation attempts to retrieve the `"City"` column from the resulting DataFrame. However, since the `"City"` column has been dropped in the previous step, this will raise a KeyError, indicating that the column is not present in the DataFrame.

( ) G

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: A. The name of the country with the most cities.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").count()`: This groups the sun DataFrame by the `"Country"` column. The `.count()` operation then returns the number of row in each group for each column. Since we're grouping by country, the count essentially gives the number of cities in each country.

- `.sort_values("Jan")`: The result of the previous operation is a DataFrame with countries as the index and counts for each column. Sorting by `"Jan"` would essentially sort the countries based on the number of cities they have.

- `.index[-1]`: This retrieves the last index from the sorted DataFrame, which, in this context, corresponds to the country with the most cities (because it would be the maximum count when sorted in ascending order by default).
