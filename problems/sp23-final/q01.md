Complete the implementation of the function `most_sunshine`, which takes
in `country`, the name of a country, and `month`, the name of a month
(e.g. `"Apr"`), and returns the name of the city (as a string) in
`country` with the most sunshine hours in `month`, among the cities in
`sun`. Assume there are no ties.

```py  
    def most_sunshine(country, month):
        country_only = __(a)__
        return country_only.__(b)__
```

What goes in blanks (a) and (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: (a): `sun[sun.get("Country") == country]`, (b): `sort_values(month).get("City").iloc[-1]` or `sort_values(month, ascending=False).get("City").iloc[0]`

**What goes in blank (a)?** `sun[sun.get("Country") == country]`
To identify cities only within the specified country, we need to query for the rows in the `sun` DataFrame where the `"Country"` column matches the given `country`. The expression `sun.get("Country") == country` creates a Boolean Series, where each entry is `True` if the corresponding row's `"Country"` column matches the provided `country` and `False` otherwise. When this Boolean series is used to index into `sun` DataFrame, it keeps only the rows for which `sun.get("Country") == country` is `True`, effectively giving us only the cities from the specified country.

**What goes in blank (b)?** `sort_values(month).get("City").iloc[-1]` or `sort_values(month, ascending=False).get("City").iloc[0]`\
To determine the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month, we sort the queried DataFrame (which only contains cities from the specified country) based on the values in the `month` column. There are two ways to achieve the desired result:

- Sort in ascending (increasing) order and then select the last item. This is because after sorting in ascending order, the city with the most sunshine hours will be at the bottom of the DataFrame. We use `.iloc[-1]` to get the last item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.
- Sort in descending order and then select the first item. After sorting in descending order, the city with the most sunshine hours will be at the top of the DataFrame. We use `.iloc[0]` to get the first item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.

Both methods will give us the name of the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: (c): `"City"`, (d): ascending, (e): drop the `"Country"` column, and reset the index

Let's start by understanding the code provided in the question:\
The `.groupby("City")` method groups the data in the `sun` DataFrame by unique city names. Since every city name in the DataFrame is unique, this means that each group will consist of just one row corresponding to that city.

After grouping by city, the `.mean()` method computes the average of each column for each group. Again, as each city name is unique, this operation doesn't aggregate multiple rows but merely reproduces the original values for each city. (For example, the value in the `"Jan"` column for the row with the index `"Hamilton"` will just be 229.8, which we see in the first row of the preview of `sun`.)

Finally, `.reset_index()` is used to reset the DataFrame's index. When using `.groupby`, the column we group by (in this case, `"City"`) becomes the index. By resetting the index, we're making `"City"` a regular column again and setting the index to 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

<br>

**What goes in blank (c)?** `"City"`\
When we group on `"City"`, the index of the DataFrame is set to `"City"` names, sorted in ascending alphabetical order (this is always the behavior of `groupby`). Since all city names are unique, the number of rows in `sun.groupby("City").mean()` is the same as the number of rows in `sun`, and so grouping on `"City"` effectively sorts the DataFrame by `"City"` and sets the index to `"City"`. To replicate the order in `cities`, then, we must sort `sun` by the `"City"` column in ascending order.

<br><br>

**What goes in blank (d)?** ascending\
Addressed above.

<average>77</average>

<br><br>

**What goes in blank (e)?** , drop the `"Country"` column, and reset the index\
In the provided code, after grouping by `"City"` and computing the mean, we reset the index. This means the `"City"` column is no longer the index but a regular column, and the DataFrame gets a fresh integer index. To replicate this structure, we need to reset the index in our sorted DataFrame. Additionally, when we applied the `.mean()` method after grouping, any non-numeric columns (like `"Country"`) that we can't take the mean of are automatically excluded from the resulting DataFrame. To match the structure of `cities`, then, we must drop the `"Country"` column from our sorted DataFrame.

True or False: In the code below, `Z` is guaranteed to evaluate to
`True`.

```py
x = sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean().shape[0]
y = sun.groupby("Country").mean().shape[0]
z = (x >= y)
```

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: True\
Let's us look at each line of code separately:

- `x = sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean().shape[0]`: This line groups the `sun` DataFrame by both `"Country"` and `"Year"`, then computes the mean. As a result, each unique combination of `"Country"` and `"Year"` will have its own row. For instance, if there are three different values in the `"Year"` column for a particular country, that country will appear three times in the DataFrame `sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean()`.

- `y = sun.groupby("Country").mean().shape[0]`: When grouping by `"Country"` alone, each unique country in the `sun` DataFrame is represented by one row, independent of the information in other columns.

- `z = (x >= y)`: This comparison checks whether the number of rows produced by grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` (which is `x`) is greater than or equal to the number of rows produced by grouping only by `"Country"` (which is `y`).

Given our grouping logic:

- If every country in the `sun` DataFrame has only a single unique value in the `"Year"` column (e.g. if the `"Year"` value for all ciites in the United States was always 3035.9, and if the `"Year"` value for all cities in Nigeria was always 1845.4, etc.), then the number of rows when grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` will be equal to the number of rows when grouping by `"Country"` alone. In this scenario, `x` will be equal to `y`.

- If at least one country in the `sun` DataFrame has at least two different values in the `"Year"` column (e.g. if there are at least two cities in the United States with different values in the `"Year"` column), then there will be more rows when grouping by both `"Country"` and `"Year"` compared to grouping by `"Country"` alone. This means `x` will be greater than `y`.

Considering the above scenarios, there's no situation where the value of `x` can be less than the value of `y`. Therefore, `z` will always evaluate to `True`.

( ) B 
( ) C 
( ) D 
( ) E 
( ) F 
( ) G

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: E. The last city, alphabetically, in the first country, alphabetically.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").max()`: This line of code groups the `sun` DataFrame by the `"Country"` column and then determines the **maximum** for every other column within each country group. Since the values in the `"City"` column are stored as strings, and the maximum of a Series of strings is the last string alphabetically, the values in the `"City"` column of this DataFrame will contain the last city, alphabetically, of each country.

- `.get("City")`: `.get("City")` accesses the `"City"` column. 

- `.iloc[0]`: Finally, `.iloc[0]` selects the `"City"` value from the first row. The first row corresponds to the first country alphabetically because `groupby` sorted the DataFrame by `"Country"` in ascending order. The value in the `"City"` column that `.iloc[0]` selects, then, is the name of the last city, alphabetically, in the first country, alphabetically.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: G. Nothing, because it errors.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").sum()`: This groups the `sun` DataFrame by the `"Country"` column and computes the sum for each numeric column within each country group. Since `"City"` is non-numeric, it will be dropped.

- `.get("City")`: This operation attempts to retrieve the `"City"` column from the resulting DataFrame. However, since the `"City"` column was dropped in the previous step, this will raise a KeyError, indicating that the column is not present in the DataFrame.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: A. The name of the country with the most cities.\

Let's break down the code:

- `sun.groupby("Country").count()`: This groups the sun DataFrame by the `"Country"` column. The `.count()` method then returns the number of rows in each group for each column. Since we're grouping by `"Country"`, and since the rows in `sun` correspond to cities, this is counting the number of cities in each country.

- `.sort_values("Jan")`: The result of the previous operation is a DataFrame with `"Country"` as the index and the number of cities per country stored in every other column. The `"City`, `"Jan"`, `"Feb"`, `"Mar"`, etc. columns in the resulting DataFrame all contain the same information. Sorting by `"Jan"` sorts the DataFrame by the number of cities each country has in ascending order.

- `.index[-1]`: This retrieves the last index value from the sorted DataFrame, which corresponds to the name of the country with the most cities.
