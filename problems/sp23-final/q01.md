Complete the implementation of the function `most_sunshine`, which takes
in `country`, the name of a country, and `month`, the name of a month
(e.g. `"Apr"`), and returns the name of the city (as a string) in
`country` with the most sunshine hours in `month`, among the cities in
`sun`. Assume there are no ties.

```py  
    def most_sunshine(country, month):
        country_only = __(a)__
        return country_only.__(b)__
```

What goes in blank (a)?


What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:\

**What goes in blank (a)?** `sun[sun.get("Country") == country]`\
To identify cities only within the specified country, we need to filter the rows in the `sun` DataFrame where the `"Country"` column matches the given `country`. The expression `sun["Country"] == country` creates a boolean series, where each entry is `True` if the corresponding row's `"Country"` column matches the provided `country` and `False` otherwise. When this boolean series is used to index the `sun` DataFrame, it filters out only those rows that are true, effectively giving us only the cities from the specified country.

**What goes in blank (b)?** `sort_values(month).get("City").iloc[-1]` or `sort_values(month, ascending=False).get("City").iloc[0]`\
To determine the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month, we sort the filtered DataFrame (which only contains cities from the specified country) based on the values in the `month` column. There are two ways to achieve the desired result:

- Sort in ascending order and then select the last item. This is because after sorting in ascending order, the city with the highest sunshine hours will be the last item. We use `.iloc[-1]` to get the last item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.

- Sort in descending order and then select the first item. After sorting in descending order, the city with the highest sunshine hours will be the first item. We use `.iloc[0]` to get the first item after selecting the `"City"` column with `.get("City")`.

Both methods will give us the name of the city with the most sunshine hours in the specified month.

In this part only, assume that all `"City"` names in `sun` are unique.

Consider the DataFrame `cities` defined below.

    cities = sun.groupby("City").mean().reset_index()

Fill in the blanks so that the DataFrame that results from the sequence
of steps described below is identical to `cities`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:\
Let's start by understanding the code provided in the question:\
The `.groupby("City")` method groups the data in the `sun` DataFrame by unique city names. Since every city name in the DataFrame is unique, this essentially means that each group will consist of just one row corresponding to that city.

After grouping by city, the `.mean()` method computes the average of each column for each group. Again, as each city name is unique, this operation doesn't aggregate multiple rows but merely reproduces the original values for each city.

Finally, `.reset_index()` is used to reset the DataFrame's index. When using `.groupby()`, the column we group by (in this case, `"City"`) becomes the index. By resetting the index, we're making `"City"` a regular column again and adding a new integer index to the DataFrame.

**What goes in blank (c)?** `"City"`\
In the code, we grouped by `"City"`, and since all city names are unique, this operation effectively sorts the DataFrame by city names. To replicate the order in the resultant `cities` DataFrame, we must sort `sun` by the `"City"` column.

**What goes in blank (d)?** ascending\
The `.groupby("City")` operation inherently sorts the `"City"` column in ascending order. To ensure our DataFrame aligns with the order of the `cities` DataFrame after the grouping operation, we need to sort the `"City"` column in ascending order.

**What goes in blank (e)?** , drop the `"Country"` column, and reset the index\
In the code, after grouping by `"City"` and computing the mean, we reset the index. This means the `"City"` column is no longer the index but a regular column, and the DataFrame gets a fresh integer index. To replicate this structure, we need to reset the index in our sorted DataFrame. Additionally, when we applied the `.mean()` method after grouping, any non-numeric columns (like `"Country"`) that don't have a meaningful average are automatically excluded from the resulting DataFrame. Thus, the `"Country"` column is not present in the `cities` DataFrame because it doesn't have a numerical mean. To match the structure of `cities`, we must drop the `"Country"` column from our sorted DataFrame.

True or False: In the code below, `Z` is guaranteed to evaluate to
`True`.

```py
    x = sun.groupby(["Country", "Year"]).mean().shape[0]
    y = sun.groupby("Country").mean().shape[0]
    z = (x >= y)

( ) True
