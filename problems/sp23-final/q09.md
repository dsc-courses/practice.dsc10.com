Suhani's passport is currently being renewed, and so she can't join
those on international summer vacations. However, her last final exam is
today, and so she decides to road trip through California this week
while everyone else takes their finals.

The chances that it is sunny this Monday and Tuesday, in various cities
in California, are given below. The event that it is sunny on Tuesday in
Los Angeles depends on the event that it is sunny on Monday in Los
Angeles, but other than that, all other events in the table are
independent of one another.

What is the probability that it is not sunny in San Diego on
Monday and not sunny in San Diego on Tuesday? Give your answer as a
**positive integer percentage** between 0% and 100%.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.18 or 18%

- The probability it is not sunny in SD on Monday is $1 - \frac{7}{10} = \frac{3}{10}$

- The probability it is not sunny in SD on Tuesday is $1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}$\

Since these events are independent, the probability of both happening is: $\frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{50} = \frac{18}{100} = 18\%$

<average>80</average>

What is the probability that it is sunny in at least one of
the three cities on Monday?

( ) $3\%$ 
( ) $31.5\%$ 
( ) $40\%$ 
( ) $68.5\%$ 
( ) $75\%$ 
( ) $97\%$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $97\%$

The event that it is sunny in at least one of the three cities on Monday is the complement of the event that it is not sunny in all three cities on Monday. The probability it is not sunny in all three cities on Monday is: $$(1 - \frac{7}{10}) \cdot (1 - \frac{3}{5}) \cdot (1 - \frac{3}{4}) = \frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{200} = \frac{3}{100} = 0.03$$\
So the probability that it is sunny in at least one of the three cities on Monday is $1 - 0.03 = 0.97$

<average>65</average>

What is the probability that it is sunny in Los Angeles on Tuesday?

( ) $15\%$ 
( ) $22.5\%$ 
( ) $40\%$ 
( ) $45\%$ 
( ) $60\%$ 
( ) $88.8\%$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $60\%$ 

The event that it is sunny in LA on Tuesday can happen in two ways:

- It is sunny in LA on Tuesday and on Monday.

- It is sunny in LA on Tuesday but not on Monday.

We need to consider these cases differently given the conditions in the table. By the multiplication rule, the probability of the first and the second case is as follow.

- The probability of the first case is: $$P(\text{sunny Monday and sunny Tuesday}) = P(\text{sunny Monday}) \cdot P(\text{sunny Tuesday given sunny Monday}) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{20}$$

- The probability of the second case is: $$P(\text{not sunny Monday and sunny Tuesday}) = P(\text{not sunny Monday}) \cdot P(\text{sunny Tuesday given not sunny Monday}) = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3}{20}$$

Since these events have no overlap, the probability of either one occurring is $\frac{9}{20} + \frac{3}{20} = \frac{12}{20} = 60\%$

<average>64</average>

Fill in the blanks so that `exactly_two` evaluates to the probability
that exactly two of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are sunny
on Monday.

*Hint: If `arr` is an array, then `np.prod(arr)` is the product of the
elements in `arr`.*

```py
    monday = np.array([7 / 10, 3 / 5, 3 / 4]) # Taken from the table.
    exactly_two = __(a)__
    for i in np.arange(3):
        exactly_two = exactly_two + np.prod(monday) * __(b)__
```

What goes in blank (a)?

What goes in blank (b)?

( ) `monday[i]`
( ) `1 - monday[i]`
( ) `1 / monday[i]`
( ) `monday[i] / (1 - monday[i])`
( ) `(1 - monday[i]) / monday[i]`
( ) `1 / (1 - monday[i])`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

**What goes in blank (a)?** 0

In the `for`-loop we add the probabilities of the three different cases, so `exactly_two` needs to start from 0.

<average>47</average>

**What goes in blank (b)?** `(1 - monday[i]) / monday[i]`

In the context of this problem, where we want to find the probability that exactly two out of the three cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) are sunny on Monday, we need to consider each possible combination where two cities are sunny and one is not. This is done by multiplying the probabilities of two cities having sunshine with the probability of the third city not having sunshine and add up all of the results.

In the code above, `np.prod(monday)` calculates the probability of all three cities (San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) being sunny, based on their respective probabilities. However, since we're interested in the case where exactly two cities are sunny, we need to adjust this calculation for each city not being sunny in turn. This adjustment is achieved by the term `(1-monday[i])/monday[i]`. Let's break down this small piece of code together:

- `1 - monday[i]`: This part calculates the probability of the ith city not being sunny. For each iteration of the loop, it represents the chance that one specific city (either San Diego, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, depending on the iteration) has no sunshine. This is essential because, for exactly two cities to be sunny, one city must not be sunny.

- `monday[i]`: This part represents the original probability of the `i`th city being sunny, which is included in the `np.prod(monday)` calculation.

- `(1-monday[i])/monday[i]`: By dividing the probability of the city not being sunny by the probability of it being sunny, we're effectively replacing the `i`th city's sunny probability in the original product `np.prod(monday)` with its not sunny probability. This adjusts the total probability to reflect the scenario where the other two cities are sunny, and the `i`th city is not.

By adding all possible combinations, it provide the probability that exactly two out of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are sunny on a given Monday.
