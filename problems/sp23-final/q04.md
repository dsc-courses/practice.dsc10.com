For each city in `sun`, we have 12 numbers, corresponding to the number
of sunshine hours it sees in January, February, March, and so on,
through December. (There is also technically a 13th number, the value in
the `"Year"` column, but we will ignore it for the purposes of this
question.)

We say that a city's number of sunshine hours **peaks gradually** if
both of the following conditions are true:

-   Each month from February to June has a number of sunshine hours
    greater than or equal to the month before it.

-   Each month from August to December has a number of sunshine hours
    less than or equal to the month before it.

For example, the number of sunshine hours per month in Doris' hometown
of Guangzhou, China peaks gradually:

$$62, 65, 71, 104, 118, 202, 181, 173, 172, 170, 166, 140$$

However, the number of sunshine hours per month in Charlie's hometown of
Redwood City, California does not peak gradually, since $325 > 311$ and
$247 < 271$:

$$185, 207, 269, 309, 325, 311, 313, 287, 247, 271, 173, 160$$

Complete the implementation of the function `peaks_gradually`, which
takes in an array `hours` of length 12 corresponding to the number of
sunshine hours per month in a city, and returns `True` if the city's
number of sunshine hours peaks gradually and `False` otherwise.

```py
    def peaks_gradually(hours):
        for i in np.arange(5):
            cur_left = hours[5 - i]
            next_left = hours[__(a)__]
            cur_right = hours[__(b)__]
            next_right = hours[6 + i + 1]

            if __(c)__:
                __(d)__
            
        __(e)__
```

What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `5 - i - 1` or `4 - i`\

For blank (a), our task is to determine the index that corresponds to the month preceding the current month, `cur_left`, on the left side of the peak (June). As we're interested in ensuring an increasing trend from January to June, we need to select an index for `next_left` that represents the month before `cur_left`:

- At `i = 0`, `cur_left` is the sunshine hours for June (index 5), so `next_left` should be the sunshine hours for May, which is at index 5 - 1 = 4.

- For each subsequent increment of `i`, `cur_left` moves one month earlier, meaning `next_left` needs to follow suit. Therefore, `next_left` is always one month behind `cur_left`.

The pattern is consistent. And since `cur_left` is set to `5 - i`, `next_left` uses the index `4 - i`, which correctly points to the sunshine hours of the preceding month as we step backward through the first half of the year.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `6 + i`\

For blank (b), we're identifying the correct index for `cur_right`, which reflects the current month’s sunshine hours on the right side of the peak (starting from July). We're aiming to observe a decreasing trend from July to December, so `cur_right` must be set to an index that accurately captures the current month as we proceed through the second half of the year:

- At `i = 0`, `cur_right` should correspond to the sunshine hours for July, situated at index 6 in the array.

- As `i` increases, `cur_right` advances one month forward, necessitating an index that shifts accordingly. Thus, for each `i`, `cur_right` must reference the sunshine hours for the month we're currently evaluating.

To follow the months from July to November, `cur_right` is correctly indexed at `6 + i`. This index ensures that as we iterate through the loop, we're always focusing on the appropriate month for the second half of the year's trend.

By setting the indices in this manner, we prepare the variables `next_left` and `cur_right` to be used in the comparisons that will establish whether the city’s sunshine hours peak gradually.

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `next_left < cur_left or next_right < cur_right`
( ) `next_left < cur_left and next_right < cur_right`
( ) `next_left > cur_left or next_right > cur_right`
( ) `next_left > cur_left and next_right > cur_right`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `next_left > cur_left or next_right > cur_right`\

For the number of sunshine hours to peak gradually according to the question's criteria:

- From February to June, the sunshine hours should not decrease, which is violated if a month has fewer sunshine hours than the previous month (`next_left > cur_left`).

- From August to December, the sunshine hours should not increase, which is violated if a month has more sunshine hours than the following month (`next_right > cur_right`).

The `or` condition here is used because if either of these scenarios is true (hours decreasing before the peak or increasing after the peak), the function should indicate that the city's number of sunshine hours does not peak gradually.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (d)?

( ) `return True` 
( ) `return False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `return False`\

In the context of the function `peaks_gradually`, when the condition `next_left > cur_left or next_right > cur_right` is met, it implies that the number of sunshine hours is not consistently decreasing from July to December (for `next_right > cur_right`) or not consistently increasing from January to June (for `next_left > cur_left`). This indicates a violation of the criteria for a city’s number of sunshine hours peaking gradually. Therefore, if either of these conditions holds true at any point in the iteration, the function should immediately return `False`, because we have encountered a month that does not adhere to the pattern required for a gradual peak.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (e)?

( ) `return True` 
( ) `return False`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `return True`\

After the `for`-loop has run its course without returning `False`, we can conclude that all the necessary comparisons have met the criteria: from February to June, each month has sunshine hours greater than or equal to the previous month, and from July to December, each month has sunshine hours less than or equal to the previous month. This successful completion of the loop without any condition failing means that the function should return `True`, indicating the input data does indeed represent a city where the number of sunshine hours peaks gradually.
