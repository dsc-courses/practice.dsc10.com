For each city in `sun`, we have 12 numbers, corresponding to the number
of sunshine hours it sees in January, February, March, and so on,
through December. (There is also technically a 13th number, the value in
the `"Year"` column, but we will ignore it for the purposes of this
question.)

We say that a city's number of sunshine hours **peaks gradually** if
both of the following conditions are true:

-   Each month from February to June has a number of sunshine hours
    greater than or equal to the month before it.

-   Each month from August to December has a number of sunshine hours
    less than or equal to the month before it.

For example, the number of sunshine hours per month in Doris' hometown
of Guangzhou, China peaks gradually:

$$62, 65, 71, 104, 118, 202, 181, 173, 172, 170, 166, 140$$

However, the number of sunshine hours per month in Charlie's hometown of
Redwood City, California does not peak gradually, since $325 > 311$ and
$247 < 271$:

$$185, 207, 269, 309, 325, 311, 313, 287, 247, 271, 173, 160$$

Complete the implementation of the function `peaks_gradually`, which
takes in an array `hours` of length 12 corresponding to the number of
sunshine hours per month in a city, and returns `True` if the city's
number of sunshine hours peaks gradually and `False` otherwise.

```py
    def peaks_gradually(hours):
        for i in np.arange(5):
            cur_left = hours[5 - i]
            next_left = hours[__(a)__]
            cur_right = hours[__(b)__]
            next_right = hours[6 + i + 1]

            if __(c)__:
                __(d)__
            
        __(e)__
```
