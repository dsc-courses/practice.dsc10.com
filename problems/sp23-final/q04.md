For each city in `sun`, we have 12 numbers, corresponding to the number
of sunshine hours it sees in January, February, March, and so on,
through December. (There is also technically a 13th number, the value in
the `"Year"` column, but we will ignore it for the purposes of this
question.)

We say that a city's number of sunshine hours **peaks gradually** if
both of the following conditions are true:

-   Each month from February to June has a number of sunshine hours
    greater than or equal to the month before it.

-   Each month from August to December has a number of sunshine hours
    less than or equal to the month before it.

For example, the number of sunshine hours per month in Doris' hometown
of Guangzhou, China peaks gradually:

$$62, 65, 71, 104, 118, 202, 181, 173, 172, 170, 166, 140$$

However, the number of sunshine hours per month in Charlie's hometown of
Redwood City, California does not peak gradually, since $325 > 311$ and
$247 < 271$:

$$185, 207, 269, 309, 325, 311, 313, 287, 247, 271, 173, 160$$

Complete the implementation of the function `peaks_gradually`, which
takes in an array `hours` of length 12 corresponding to the number of
sunshine hours per month in a city, and returns `True` if the city's
number of sunshine hours peaks gradually and `False` otherwise.

```py
    def peaks_gradually(hours):
        for i in np.arange(5):
            cur_left = hours[5 - i]
            next_left = hours[__(a)__]
            cur_right = hours[__(b)__]
            next_right = hours[6 + i + 1]

            if __(c)__:
                __(d)__
            
        __(e)__
```

What goes in blank (a)?

**Answer**: `5 - i - 1` or `4 - i`\

Before filling in the blanks, let's discuss the overall strategy of the problem. The idea is as follows

- When $i = 0$,
    -  Compare `cur_left`, which is the sunshine hours for June (month 5, since $5 - i = 5 - 0 = 5$), to `next_left`, which is the sunshine hours for May (month $5 - i - 1 = 4$). If `next_left > cur_left`, it means that May has more sunshine hours than June, which means the sunshine hours for this city don't peak gradually. (Remember, for the number of sunshine hours to peak gradually, we need it to be the case that each month from February to June has a number of sunshine hours greater than or equal to the month before it.)
    - Also, compare `cur_right`, which is the sunshine hours for July (month 6, since $6 + i = 6 + 0 = 6$), to `next_right`, which is the sunshine hours for August (month $6 + i + 1 = 7$). If `next_right > cur_right`, it means that August has more sunshine hours than July, which means the sunshine hours for this city don't peak gradually. (Remember, for the number of sunshine hours to peak gradually, we need it to be the case that each month from August to December has a number of sunshine hours less than or equal to the month before it.)
    - If `next_left > cur_left or next_right > cur_right`, then we don't need to look at any other pairs of months, and can just `return False`. Otherwise, we keep looking.
- When $i = 1$, `cur_left` and `next_left` will "step backwards" and refer to May (month 4, since $5 - i = 5 - 1 = 4$) and April (month 3, since $5 - i - 1 = 3$), respectively. Simililarly, `cur_right` and `next_right` will "step forwards" and refer to August and September, respectively. The above process is repeated.
- This is repeated until we check January (month 0) / February (month 1) and November (month 10) / December (month 11); if by that point, the condition `next_left > cur_left or next_right > cur_right` was never `True`, then it must be the case that the sunshine hours for this city peak gradually, and we can `return True` outside of the `for`-loop!

Focusing on blank (a) specifically, it needs to contain the position of `next_left`, which is the index of the month before the current left month. Since the current month is at `5 - i`, the next month needs to be at `5 - i - 1`.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `6 + i`\

Using the same logic as for blank (a), blank (b) needs to contain the position of `cur_right`, which is the index of the month before the next right month. Since the next right month is at `6 + i + 1`, the current right month is at `6 + i`.
