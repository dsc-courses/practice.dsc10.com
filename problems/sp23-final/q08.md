Australia is in the southern hemisphere, meaning that its summer season
is from December through February, when we have our winter. As a result,
January is typically one of the sunniest months in Australia!

Arjun is a big fan of the movie Kangaroo Jack and plans on visiting
Australia this January. In doing his research on where to go, he found
the number of sunshine hours in January for the 15 Australian cities in
`sun` and sorted them in **descending** order.

$$356, 337, 325, 306, 294, 285, 285, 266, 263, 257, 255, 254, 220, 210, 176$$

Throughout this question, use the mathematical definition of percentiles
presented in class.

What is the 80th percentile of the collection of numbers above?

( ) 254 
( ) 255 
( ) 294 
( ) 306 
( ) 325 
( ) 337

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 306

First, we need to find the position of the 80th percentile using the following equation:

$$h = \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) \cdot 15 = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 15 = 12$$

Since 12 is an integer, we don't need to round up, so $k = 12$. Starting from the right-most number, which is the smallest number and hence position 1 here, the 12th number is 306.

What is the **largest** positive integer $p$ such that 257 is the $p$th
percentile of the collection of numbers above?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 40

The first step is to find the position of 257 in the collection, when we start at position 1, which is 6. Since there are 15 values total, this means that 257 is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to 40% of the values.

What is the **smallest** positive integer $p$ such that 257 is the $p$th
percentile of the collection of numbers above? (Make sure your answer to
(c) is smaller than your answer to (b)!)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 34

Let's look at the next number down from 257, which is 255. 255 is the 5th number out of 15, so it is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to 33.333% of the values. This means the 33rd percentile is also 255, since 33.333 > 33. However, 255 is not greater than or equal to 34% of the values, which makes the 34th percentile 257. Therefore, 34 is the smallest percentile that is equal to 257.

Teresa also wants to go to Australia, but can't take time off work in
January, and so she plans a trip to The Land Down Under (Australia) in
February instead. She finds that the mean number of sunshine hours in
February for all 15 Australian cities in `sun` is 250, with a standard
deviation of 15.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

According to Chebyshev's inequality, at least what percentage of
Australian cities in `sun` see between 200 and 300 sunshine hours in
February?

( ) 9% 
( ) 30% 
( ) 33.3% 
( ) 91% 
( ) 95% 
( ) 99.73%

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 91%

$$z = \frac{250 - 200}{15} = \frac{50}{15} = \frac{10}{3}$$

The above equation tells us that 200 is $\frac{10}{3}$ standard deviations below the mean, and 300 is the same number of standard deviations above the mean. Chebyshev's inequality tells us the proportion of values within $z$ SDs of the mean is at least $1 - \frac{1}{z^2}$, which here is:

$$1 - \frac{1}{\left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2} = 1 - \frac{9}{100} = 0.91$$
