Australia is in the southern hemisphere, meaning that its summer season
is from December through February, when we have our winter. As a result,
January is typically one of the sunniest months in Australia!

Arjun is a big fan of the movie Kangaroo Jack and plans on visiting
Australia this January. In doing his research on where to go, he found
the number of sunshine hours in January for the 15 Australian cities in
`sun` and sorted them in **descending** order.

$$356, 337, 325, 306, 294, 285, 285, 266, 263, 257, 255, 254, 220, 210, 176$$

Throughout this question, use the mathematical definition of percentiles
presented in class.

Teresa also wants to go to Australia, but can't take time off work in
January, and so she plans a trip to The Land Down Under (Australia) in
February instead. She finds that the mean number of sunshine hours in
February for all 15 Australian cities in `sun` is 250, with a standard
deviation of 15.
