Below is a bar chart and the code that produced it.

    (words.sort_values(by="diff", ascending=False).take(np.arange(20))
          .plot(kind='barh', y="diff"));

Determine whether each statement below is true or false.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Students found the word "decades\" more difficult than any other word.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

We can see on the bar chart that there were 5 other words with the same diff value as decades, so the answer is False.

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If we removed `ascending = False` from the code, the bar chart would
show the same information, except the bars would appear in the opposite
order from top to bottom.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

We are only plotting the first 20 rows of words after sorting it. So,
currently we have plotted the 20 words with the highest diff value. If we removed
ascending = False then it would sort in ascending order and we would only be
plotting the 20 words with the lowest diff value. They would not be the same words.

<average>46</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

This bar chart shows all words that more than 20 students found
difficult. If we changed `np.arange(20)` to `np.arange(15)` in the code,
the bar chart would instead show all words that more than 15 students
found difficult.

( ) True 
( ) False


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: False

`.take(np.arange(20))` takes the elements at those positional indices.
`.take(np.arange(15))` would take less elements, so there is no way that it would
include more students in the bar chart

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
