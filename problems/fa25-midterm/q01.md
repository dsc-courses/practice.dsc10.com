# BEGIN PROB

Each value in the `"ps"` column is a string formatted like
`"(word, tag)"`, where the first part is the word and the second part is
a tag indicating the word's part of speech (e.g. `"(getting, VBG)"`).
Note that the word and the part of speech tag are each enclosed in
single quotes. To clean the column so that `"ps"` contains **only** the
part of speech tag, we run the following line of code.

        words = words.assign(ps = words.get("ps").apply(fix_ps))

After we run this line of code, the first five rows of `words` should
appear as follows.

Which of the following options correctly define the function `fix_ps` to
produce the desired result? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] `def fix_ps(x): return x.split("'")[3]`
[ ] `def fix_ps(x): return x.split(",")[1].strip("')")`
[ ] `def fix_ps(x): return x.split(", ")[1].strip("')")`
[ ] `def fix_ps(x): return x.split(", ")[1].strip(")").strip("'")`
[ ] `def fix_ps(x): return x.split(", ")[1].strip("'").strip(")")` 
[ ] None of the above.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

Let's consider all the answer options using `x = "(’getting’, ’VBG’)"` as our example.

**Option 1:**\
`x.split("’") = ["(", "getting", ", ", "VBG", ")"][3] = "VBG"`\
This is exactly what we want.

**Option 2:**\
`1. x.split(",") = ["(’getting’", " ’VBG’)"][1] = " ’VBG’)"`\
`2. " ’VBG’)" .strip("’)") = " ’VBG"`\
Note that `strip` does not remove the exact substring it's given;
instead, it removes all leading and trailing characters that appear in
the given set of characters.So, this code removes any leading/trailing
instances of single quote `"’"` and right parenthesis `")"`. `" ’VBG’)"`
starts with a space, which is not in the argument to `strip`, so nothing
is removed from the front. It ends with both `"’"` and `")"`, so both
are removed, leaving `" ’VBG"`. Thus, this option is incorrect.\

**Option 3:**\
`1. x.split(", ") = ["(’getting’", "’VBG’)"][1] = "’VBG’)"`\
`2. "’VBG’)" .strip("’)") = "VBG"`\
Here, `strip` removes any leading and trailing instances of `"’"` and
`")"`. `"’VBG’)"` starts with `"’"`, which is removed; it ends with
`"’"` and `")"`, which are also removed, leaving `"VBG"`. Thus, this
option is correct.\

**Option 4:**\
`1. x.split(", ") = ["(’getting’", "’VBG’)"][1] = "’VBG’)"`\
`2. "’VBG’)" .strip(")") = "’VBG’"`\
`3. "’VBG’" .strip("’") = "VBG"`\
The first strip removes any leading and trailing instances of `")"`, so
the last character of `"’VBG’)"` is removed to become `"’VBG’"`. The
second strip removes any leading and trailing instances of `"’"`, so the
first and last characters of `"’VBG’"` are removed to become `"VBG"`.
Thus, this option is correct.\

**Option 5:**\
`1. x.split(", ") = ["(’getting’", "’VBG’)"][1] = "’VBG’)"`\
`2. "’VBG’)".strip(" ’") = "VBG’)"`\
`3. "VBG’)".strip(")") = "VBG’"`\
The first strip removes any leading and trailing instances of `" "` and
`"’"`, so the first character of `"’VBG’)"` is removed to become
`"VBG’)"`. The second strip removes any leading and trailing instances
of `")"`, so the last character of `"VBG’)"` is removed to become
`"VBG’"`. Incorrect.\

**Therefore, the correct options are 1, 3, and 4.**
