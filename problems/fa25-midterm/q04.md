# BEGIN PROB

The function below classifies the length of a word as `"short"`,
`"medium"`, or `"long"`. Its input, `x`, represents the length of a word
and will always be a positive integer.

    def classify_length(x):
        if x <= 6:
            return "short"
        elif x <= 10:
            return "medium"
        else:
            return "long"

Fill in the blanks of the function below so that `classify_length_2`
gives the same output as `classify_length` on all positive integer
inputs. Each blank must be filled in with a **single line** of code.

    def classify_length_2(x):
        if __(a)__:
            return "medium"
        if x >= 7:
            __(b)__
        __(c)__

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `x > 6 and x <= 10`

We know that we need to return medium given this condition, so the answer is `x > 6 and x <= 10`. x > 6 comes from the
short condition, x = 10 is in the original classify length.

`(b)`: `return "long"`

Since the condition has x be larger, we know that we should `return "long"`.

`(c)`: `return "short"`.

This will be the last, non-covered classification, so it should be `return "short"`.
