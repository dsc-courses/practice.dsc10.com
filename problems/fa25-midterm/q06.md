# BEGIN PROB

The DataFrame `long` was created by taking the $500$ rows of `words`
corresponding to words whose `"length"` is more than $10$. Of the $500$
words in `long`,

-   $100$ words were marked difficult by $5$ or more students, and
-   no words were marked difficult by more than $25$ students.

The density histogram below was created using the data in the `"diff"`
column of `long`. The `bins` argument was set as
`bins=np.arange(5, 30, 5)` so the histogram **does not include** words
that fewer than 5 students marked difficult.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many words were marked difficult by $10$ or more students? Give your
answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $50$

To find the number of words marked difficult by 10 or more students, we
can calculate $100 \; -$ {the number of words marked difficult by at
least 5 students or less than 10 students}, or $100 \; -$ {the number of
words in bin \[5,10)}.\

Number of words in bin $[5,10) = (5)(.10)(100) = 50$\

$100 - 50 = 50$ words marked difficult by at least 10 students.\

We can also use $1 \; -$ {proportion of total words in bin $[5,10)$},
then multiply by 100. Similarly, we can directly calculate the necessary
proportion of students by using the area of 3 rightmost bins.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we regenerated the histogram using the same data, but setting
the `bins` argument as `bins=np.arange(0, 30, 5)`.

1.  What would be the height of the bar $[5, 10)$? Give your answer as a
    decimal number.

2.  What would be the height of the bar $[0, 5)$? Give your answer as a
    decimal number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (Part 1)**: $0.02$

We know that there are 50 words in the bin $[5,10)$.\
Now, however, the histogram is showing all 500 words. So the
proportion of words in bin $[5,10)$ is $\frac{50}{500} = 0.1$.\
To find the height of bar $[5,10)$, we use:

$5 \cdot {h} = 0.1$\
$h = \frac{0.1}{5} = 0.02$

**Answer (Part 2)**: $0.16$


We know that 100 words were marked difficult by 5 or more students,
so that means $500 - 100 = 400$ words were marked difficult by less
than 5 students.\
    \
So $\frac{400}{500} = 0.8 =$\
{proportion of total words that less than 5 students found difficult}.\

To find the height of bar $[0,5)$, we use:

$5 \cdot {h} = 0.8$\
$h = \frac{0.8}{5} = 0.16$

<average>57</average>
