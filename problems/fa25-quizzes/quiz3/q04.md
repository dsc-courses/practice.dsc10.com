You compute the following statistics about the `"top_speed"` column:

    mean = 14.6
    median = 16.3

You also know that **no cat** ran at a top speed of exactly $14.6$ or
$16.3$ miles per hour. Select all true statements.

[ ] Exactly half of the cats had a top speed greater than $16.3$ miles per hour.
[ ] There must be at least one cat with a top speed between $14.6$ and $16.3$ miles per hour.
[ ] The output of `(cats.get("top_speed") - 16.3).sum() > 0` is `True`.
[ ] If we were to add a row to `cats` for a cat with a top speed of $20$ miles per hour, the median **must** increase.
[ ] None of the above.
