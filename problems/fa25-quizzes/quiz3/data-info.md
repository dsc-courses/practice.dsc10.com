Suppose that at the cat adoption center, all cats stay for just one day before being adopted. The `cats` DataFrame contains a **simple random sample of 500 cats** from the adoption center. In addition to each cat's `"name"` (str), we have the following information about their single day at the adoption center: number of `"treats"` consumed (int), `"nap_time"` in hours (float), and `"top_speed"` (float) in miles per hour. `cats` is sorted in **descending** order of `"top_speed"` with the first few rows shown.
