# BEGIN PROB

Ryan runs the code below to make a single array with the contents of the
`"students"` columns from both `summer` and `fall`.

        combined = np.append(summer.get("students"), fall.get("students"))

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Select all of the true statements below:

[ ] The mean of `combined` is $220$.
[ ] The mean of `combined` is in the range $(40,400)$.
[ ] The standard deviation of `combined` is less than 10.
[ ] The standard deviation of `combined` is greater than 10.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Options 2 and 4.

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Since he was in a rush, Ryan asked ChatGPT to write code that
standardizes `combined`. To his surprise, $90\%$ of the *standardized*
data is less than 0. Which of the following best explains this
situation?

( ) Ryan should be surprised; this must have incorrectly standardized the data.
( ) Ryan should be surprised; a number of students cannot be negative.
( ) Ryan should not be surprised; it's possible for $100\%$ of the data to be below $0$.
( ) Ryan should not be surprised; his data is skewed.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option 4.

<average>66</average>
