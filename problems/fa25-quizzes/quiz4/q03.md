# BEGIN PROB

For this question only, suppose we know that `summer.get("students")` is
normally distributed. You randomly select one number from
`summer.get("students")`. Using the function `scipy.stats.norm.cdf`,
write **one line of code** that evaluates to the probability that the
number you selected is in the range $[30,45]$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0.5) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-1)`

<average>55</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
