Super Smash Brothers history. Write one line of Python code that

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
The name of the fighter with the earliest origin `"Year"` (or in the case of a tie, any fighter from the earliest origin `"Year"`).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `smash.sort_values(by = "Year").get("Name").iloc[0]` OR `smash.set_index("Name").sort_values(by = "Year").index[0]`

<average>63</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
