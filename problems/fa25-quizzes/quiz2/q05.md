Let `calories` and `protein` be `numpy` arrays containing the calorie
and protein amounts, as ints, for each of the 30 ingredients in
`chipotle`. Fill in the blanks so that the code below calculates the
number of ingredients with a calorie-to-protein ratio of at least 5.

    count = __(a)__
    for i in np.arange(__(b)__):
        if calories[i] / protein[i] >= 5:
            count = __(c)__



# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: 0 \
`(b)`: `len(calories)` \
`(c)`: `count + 1`

<average>76</average>
