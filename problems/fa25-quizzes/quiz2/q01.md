# BEGIN PROB

For a typical diet, the recommended daily protein intake is 80 g. Fill
in the blanks in the code below to add a new column to `chipotle` that
contains values 0 to 100 representing the percentage of the recommended
daily protein intake each ingredient provides.

    def clean_protein(grams): 
        return int(grams.split(" ")[__(a)__]) / __(b)__ * 100 

    chipotle = chipotle.assign(protein_percent = __(c)__) 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `0` \
`(b)`: `80` \
`(c)`: `chipotle.get("protein").apply(clean_protein)`

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION
