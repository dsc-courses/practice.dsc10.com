Leander collected a simple random sample of 500 Major League Baseball players, stored in the DataFrame `mlb` shown below. The data includes each player's name (`"player"`), overall skill on a 0 to 100 scale (`"skill"`), `"team"`, `"position"`, and batting side (`"bat"`), which has values `"Left"` and `"Right"`. Another DataFrame, `soxcards` (shown below `mlb`), was created to summarize the distribution of positions for two teams, the Red Sox and the Cardinals, where `"IF"` represents all infield positions, including `"C"`, `"1B"`, `"2B"`, `"3B"`, and `"SS"`.
