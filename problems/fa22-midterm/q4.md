Suppose we've run the following line of code.
​
```py
counts = evs.groupby("Brand").count()
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What value does `counts.get("Range").sum()` evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 32 

`counts` is a DataFrame with one row per `"Brand"`, since we grouped by `"Brand"`. Since we used the `.count()` aggregation method, the columns in `counts` will all be the same – they will all contain the number of rows in `evs` for each `"Brand"` (i.e. they will all contain the distribution of `"Brand"`). If we sum up the values in any one of the columns in `counts`, then, the result will be the total number of rows in `evs`, which we know to be 32. Thus, `counts.get("Range").sum()` is 32.

<average>56</average>

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What value does `counts.index[3]` evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Tesla"`

Since we grouped by `"Brand"` to create `counts`, the index of `counts` will be `"Brand"`, sorted alphabetically (this sorting happens automatically when grouping). This means that `counts.index` will be the array-like sequence `["Audi", "BMW", "Nissan", "Tesla"]`, and `counts.index[3]` is `"Tesla"`.
