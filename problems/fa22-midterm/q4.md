# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we've run the following line of code.
â€‹
```py
counts = evs.groupby("Brand").count()
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What value does `counts.get("Range").sum()` evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: 32 ** 

Note that `evs.groupby("Brand").count()` will group the dataframe by each brand and return the count of each brand in each column. Thus getting the `"Range"` column and summing it will simply just sum the number of cars for each brand, which is just the total number of cars there are in the dataframe, or 32.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What value does `counts.index[3]` evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: Tesla ** 

Note that groupby will automatically sort the resulting indices in ascending order, and since `'Tesla'` is last (or has value index 3) in terms of alphabetical order, our answer is just `'Tesla'`.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# END PROB
