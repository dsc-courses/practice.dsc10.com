TritonTrucks is an EV startup run by UCSD alumni. Their signature EV, the TritonTruck, has a subpar battery (the engineers didn't pay attention in their Chemistry courses).

A new TritonTruck's battery needs to be replaced after 500 days, unless it fails first, in which case it needs to be replaced immediately. On any given day, the probability that a given TritonTruck's battery fails is 0.02, independent of all other days.

Fill in the blanks so that `average_days_until_replacement` is an estimate of the **average number of days a new TritonTruck's battery lasts without needing to be replaced**.

```py
def days_until_replacement(daily_conditions):
          days = 0
          for i in __(a)__:
              if daily_conditions[i] == True:
                  __(b)__
              else:
                  return days
          return days
      total = 0
      repetitions = 10000
      for i in np.arange(repetitions):
          # The first element of the first argument to np.random.choice is
          # chosen with probability 0.98
          daily_conditions = np.random.choice(__(c)__, 500, p=[0.98, 0.02])
          total = total + days_until_replacement(daily_conditions)
      average_days_until_replacement = total / repetitions
```

(3 pts) What goes in blank (a)? 

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** `range(len(daily_conditions))` or `np.arange(len(daily_conditions))`

Since we want to loop through each element in the `daily_conditions`, we use a for loop. We can access each element by its index `i` (e.g. `daily_conditions[i]`), which starts from 0 and ends at `len(daily_conditions)`-1.

(3 pts) What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** `days = days + 1` or `days += 1`

If `daily_conditions[i]` is `True`, it means that the TritonTruck's battery is still working on that day, so we increase the `days` which record the number of days by 1.

(3 pts) What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** `[True, False]` or `np.array([True, False])`

Recall, the first parameter in `np.random.choice()` is an array that contains all possible options we are choosing from. Thus, in this case, it is `[True, False]` (Whether or not the TritonTruck's battery is still working). We put `True` at first since it has a probability of `0.98`, which is the first element in `p` (the third parameter that indicates the probability of each event happening).
