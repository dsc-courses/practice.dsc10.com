# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we've run the following two lines of code.
â€‹
```py
first = evs.get("Brand").apply(max) 
second = evs.get("Brand").max()
```

Note:

 - The length of a value `v` is defined as `len(v)`, unless `v` is a DataFrame, in which case its length is `v.shape[0]`.
 - If `s` is a string, then `max(s)` also evaluates to a string.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks: `first` is a __(i)__ of length __(ii)__.

(i)
( ) list
( ) array
( ) string
( ) DataFrame
( ) Series

(ii): _____

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: (i) Series (ii) 32 ** 

Note that `apply(max)` would go through every entry in the `"Brand"` column and find the max value of each brand (ie, it'll find the highest alphabetically ordered character of each brand). And so `apply(max)` would return a Series of length 32, where each entry in the Series is a single character.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks: `second` is a __(i)__ of length __(ii)__.

(i)
( ) list
( ) array
( ) string
( ) DataFrame
( ) Series

(ii): _____

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: (i) String (ii) 5 ** 

`max()` will return the brand name of the highest alphabetical order. In this case, it'll return `"Tesla"` since `"Tesla"` is last if we sort the brand names in chronological order.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
