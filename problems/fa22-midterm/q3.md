# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we've run the following two lines of code.
â€‹
```py
first = evs.get("Brand").apply(max) 
second = evs.get("Brand").max()
```

Note:

 - The length of a value `v` is defined as `len(v)`, unless `v` is a DataFrame, in which case its length is `v.shape[0]`.
 - If `s` is a string, then `max(s)` also evaluates to a string.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks: `first` is a \_\_(i)\_\_ of length \_\_(ii)\_\_.

(i):

( ) list
( ) array
( ) string
( ) DataFrame
( ) Series

(ii): _____

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- (i): Series 
- (ii): 32

The `.apply` method applies a function on every element of a Series. Here, `evs.get("Brand").apply(max)` applies the `max` function on every element of the `"Brand"` column of `evs`, producing a new Series with the same length as `evs`.

While not necessary to answer the question, if `s` is a string, then `max(s)` evaluates to the single character in `s` that is last in the alphabet. For instance, `max("zebra")` evaluates to `"z"`. As such, `evs.get("Brand").apply(max)` is a Series of 32 elements, each of which is a single character, corresponding to the latest character in the alphabet for each entry in `evs.get("Brand")`.

Fill in the blanks: `second` is a \_\_(i)\_\_ of length \_\_(ii)\_\_.

(i):

( ) list
( ) array
( ) string
( ) DataFrame
( ) Series

(ii): _____

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- (i): string 
- (ii): 5

The `.max()` method will find the "largest" element in the Series it is called in, which in this case is `evs.get("Brand")`. The way that strings are ordered is alphabetically, so `evs.get("Brand").max()` will be the last value of `"Brand"` alphabetically. Since we were told that the only values in the `"Brand"` column are `"Tesla"`, `"BMW"`, `"Audi"`, and `"Nissan"`, the "maximum" is `"Tesla"`, which has a length of 5.
