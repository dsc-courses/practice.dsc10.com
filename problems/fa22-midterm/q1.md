TritonTire, a UCSD alumni-run car repair shop, has an electronic database of all services it has ever provided, dating back to 1987.
The owner, Dasha, says:

> Our collective records from all 50 states show that, over the years, our repair shops have performed more and more repairs on EVs. After discussing this with our employees, we believe this is because newer EVs are not made to the same standards as the gasoline cars before them.

In **at most two sentences**, identify the largest confounding factor that Dasha has not considered in her argument. Your answer must fit in the box below.
