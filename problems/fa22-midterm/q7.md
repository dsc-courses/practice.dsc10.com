Below, we provide the same DataFrame as shown at the start of Question 6, which contains the distribution of "BodyStyle" for all "Brands" in evs, other than Nissan.

Suppose weâ€™ve run the following few lines of code.

```py
tesla = evs[evs.get("Brand") == "Tesla"]
bmw = evs[evs.get("Brand") == "BMW"]
audi = evs[evs.get("Brand") == "Audi"]

combo = tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle").merge(audi, on="BodyStyle")
```

How many rows does the DataFrame combo have?

( ) 21
( ) 24
( ) 35
( ) 65
( ) 72
( ) 96

**Answer: ** 35

Recall, when we use `.merge()`, the resulting DataFrame contains a single row for every match between the two columns, and rows in either DataFrame without a match disappear. 

Thus, to know the number of rows of `tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle")`, we first find the number of Evs in SUV and Sedan with common `"BodyStyle"`, which are SUV and Sedan, then compute the number of rows by $4\cdot 1+3 \cdot 1 = 7$. So, `tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle")` results in a DataFrame with a total of 7 rows, with 4 rows of SUV EVs and 3 rows of Sedan EVs. 

To know the number of rows of `tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle").merge(audi, on="BodyStyle")`, we first find the common `"BodyStyle"` of `tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle")` DataFrame and BMW Evs, which are SUV and Sedan, then compute the number of rows by $4\cdot 8+3 \cdot 1 = 35$. So, `tesla.merge(bmw, on="BodyStyle").merge(audi, on="BodyStyle")` results in a DataFrame with a total of 35 rows.
