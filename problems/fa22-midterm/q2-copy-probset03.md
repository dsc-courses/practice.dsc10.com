Which type of visualization should we use to visualize the distribution of `"Range"`?

( ) Bar chart
( ) Histogram
( ) Scatter plot
( ) Line plot

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Histogram

`"Range"` is a numerical (i.e. quantitative) variable, and we use histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.

- A bar chart couldn't work here. Bar charts can show the distribution of a categorical variable, but `"Range"` is not categorical.
- A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between two numerical variables, but we are only dealing with one numerical variable here (`"Range"`).
- Similarly, a line plot visualizes the relationship between two numerical variables, but we only have one here.

Teslas, on average, tend to have higher `"Range"`s than BMWs. In which of the following visualizations would we be able to see this pattern? Select all that apply.

[ ] A bar chart that shows the distribution of `"Brand"`
[ ] A bar chart that shows the average `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`
[ ] An overlaid histogram showing the distribution of `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`
[ ] A scatter plot with `"TopSpeed"` on the $x$-axis and `"Range"` on the $y$-axis

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- A bar chart that shows the average `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`
- An overlaid histogram showing the distribution of `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`

Let's look at each option more closely.

- **Option 1:** A bar chart showing the distribution of `"Brand"` would only show us how many cars of each `"Brand"` there are. It would not tell us anything about the average `"Range"` of each `"Brand"`.

- **Option 2:** A bar chart showing the average range for each `"Brand"` would help us directly visualize how the average range of each `"Brand"` compares to one another.

- **Option 3:** An overlaid histogram, although perhaps a bit messy, would also give us a general idea of the average range of each `"Brand"` by giving us the distribution of the `"Range"` of each brand. In the scenario mentioned in the question, we'd expect to see that the Tesla distribution is further right than the BMW distribution.

- **Option 4:** A scatter plot of `"TopSpeed"` against `"Range"` would only illustrate the relationship between `"TopSpeed"` and `"Range"`, but would contain no information about the `"Brand"` of each EV.
