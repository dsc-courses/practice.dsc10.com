The DataFrame below shows the distribution of `"BodyStyle"` for all `"Brands"` in `evs`, other than Nissan. We will call EVs made by a `"Brand"` other than Nissan “non-Nissan EVs”; there are 24 non-Nissan EVs in evs.

Use the information above to answer the following questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select one of the non-Nissan EVs and it is either an SUV or a sedan. What is the most likely `"Brand"` of the randomly selected non-Nissan EV?

( ) Tesla
( ) BMW
( ) Audi

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Audi

Let's compute the number of EVs that are either SUVs or sedans for each non-Nissan Brand. (To do this, we'll look at the right-most two columns in the DataFrame provided.)

- Number of Teslas that are SUVs or sedans: $4 + 3 = 7$
- Number of BMWs that are SUVs or sedans: $1 + 1 = 2$
- Number of Audis that are SUVs or sedans: $8 + 1 = 9$

Since Audi is the `"Brand"` with the most total SUVs and sedans, it is the most likely `"Brand"` to be selected.

Note: You _could_ compute conditional probabilities for each brand, if you'd like, by dividing the counts above by 18 (the total number of SUVs and sedans). For instance, $P(\text{EV is a BMW given that EV is an SUV or sedan}) = \frac{2}{18}$. The `"Brand"` with the highest count (Audi, with 9 SUVs or sedans) is also the `"Brand"` with the highest conditional probability of being selected given that the selected car is an SUV or sedan (Audi, with $\frac{9}{18}$).

Suppose we randomly select two of the non-Nissan EVs without replacement. The probability that both are BMWs is equal to $\frac{1}{k}$ , where k is a positive integer. What is k?

( ) 8
( ) 56
( ) 64
( ) 84
( ) 92
( ) 108

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 92

In the first selection, the probability of selecting a BMW is $\frac{1+1+1}{24} = \frac{3}{24}$ (3 is the total number of EVs that are BMW, and 24 is the total number of non-Nissan EVs as given by the question). 

In the second selection, since we select **without replacement**, there are only 23 EVs we can select from. Given that in the first selection we already selected 1 BMW, there are only 2 BMWs left among the 23 EVs left. Thus, the probability of getting a BMW in the second selection is $\frac{2}{23}$. 

Putting this all together, the probability that both selections are BMWs is 

$$\frac{3}{24}\cdot\frac{2}{23} = \frac{6}{24} \cdot \frac{1}{23} =\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{23} = \frac{1}{92}$$

So, $k = 92$.

Suppose we randomly select one of the non-Nissan EVs and it is an SUV. What is the probability that it is made by Tesla? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{4}{13}$

The question is asking for the proportion of SUVs that are made by Tesla.

We first need to find the number of SUVs in the DataFrame provided, which is $4 + 1 + 8 = 13$. Of those 13 SUVs, 4 are made by Tesla. Thus, the proportion of SUVs made by Tesla is $\frac{4}{13}$, so the probability that a randomly selected SUV is made by Tesla is $\frac{4}{13}$.

<average>66</average>
