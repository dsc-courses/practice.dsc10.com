The DataFrame below shows the distribution of `"BodyStyle"` for all `"Brands"` in `evs`, other than Nissan. We will call EVs made by a `"Brand"` other than Nissan “non-Nissan EVs”; there are 24 non-Nissan EVs in evs.

Use the information above to answer the following questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

(3 pts) Suppose we randomly select one of the non-Nissan EVs and it is either an SUV or a sedan. What is the most likely `"Brand"` of the randomly selected non-Nissan EV?

( ) Tesla
( ) BMW
( ) Audi

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Audi

We compute the number of EVs that are either SUVs or sedans for each non-Nissan Brand.

number of SUV and Sedan in Tesla = $4+3=7$

number of SUV and Sedan in BMW = $1+1=2$

number of SUV and Sedan in Audi = $8+1=9$

Since Audi is the brand with the most number of SUV and Sedan among the three brands, it is the most likely `"Brand"` to be selected.

(3 pts) Suppose we randomly select two of the non-Nissan EVs without replacement. The probability that both are BMWs is equal to $\frac{1}{k}$ , where k is a positive integer. What is k?

( ) 8
( ) 56
( ) 64
( ) 84
( ) 92
( ) 108

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** 92

In the first selection, the probability of selecting a BMW EV is $\frac{(1+1+1)}{24} = \frac{1}{8}$ (1+1+1 is the total number of EVs that are BMW, 24 is the total number of non-Nissan EVs as given by the question). 

In the second selection, since we select **without replacement**, there are only 23 Evs we can select from. Given that in the first selection we already select 1 BMW, there are only 2 BMWs left in the 24 Evs. Thus, the probability of getting a BMW in the second selection is $\frac{2}{23}$. Thus, the probability of both selections are BMWs is $\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{2}{23} = \frac{2}{8 \cdot 23}=\frac{1}{4 \cdot 23}=\frac{1}{92}$. $k = 92$.

(3 pts) Suppose we randomly select one of the non-Nissan EVs and it is an SUV. What is the probability that it is made by Tesla? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** $\frac{4}{13}$

The question is asking the proportion of SUV EVs that is made by Tesla. We first compute the number of EVs that are SUVs. 

number of SUV = $4+1+8=13$

We then find the number of SUV that are from Tesla, which is 4. 

Thus, the proportion of SUV Evs that are made by Tesla = $\frac{4}{13}$
