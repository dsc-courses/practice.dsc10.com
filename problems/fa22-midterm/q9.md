How many EVs in evs have exactly 6 seats?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 3

Here are two ways to solve this problem. In both solutions, we only look at Histogram A, since only Histogram A contains a bin that corresponds to EVs with exactly 6 `"Seats"`. Recall, in histograms, bins are inclusive of the left endpoint and exclusive of the right endpoint, which means the [6, 7) bin represents EVs with >= 6 `"Seats"` and < 7 `"Seats"`; since the number of `"Seats"` is a whole number, this corresponds to exactly 6 `"Seats"`.

**Solution 1**

Since the bin [6, 7) has a width of 1, its height is equal to its area, which is equal to the proportion of values in that bin. There are 32 values total, so all proportions (and, thus, the height of the [6, 7) bar) must be a multiple of $\frac{1}{32}$. The height is close to but just under 0.01; this implies the height is $\frac{3}{32}$, since that is also close to but just under 0.01 ($\frac{4}{32}$ is way above and $\frac{2}{32}$ is way below). So, we conclude that the number of EVs with 6 seats is 3.

**Solution 2**

The height of the [6, 7) bar is ever-so-slightly less than 0.1. If it's height was 0.1, it would imply that the proportion of values in the [6, 7) bin was $0.1 \cdot (7 - 6) = 0.1$, which would imply that the number of values in the [6, 7) bin is $0.1 \cdot 32 = 3.2$. However, since the number of values in a bin must be an integer, the number of values in this bin is 3 (which is slightly less than 3.2).

How many EVs in evs have exactly 5 seats?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 22

Now, we must look at Histogram B. In the previous part, we computed that there are 3 EVs with exactly 6 `"Seats"` in `evs`. Histogram B shows us the proportion, and thus number, of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"`, through its [5, 7) bin (remember, this bin corresponds to EVs with >= 5 `"Seats"` and < 7 `"Seats"`). If we can find the number of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"`, we can subtract 3 from it to determine the number of EVs with exactly 5 `"Seats"`.

Since it's not quite clear what the height of the [5, 7) bar is, we can create a _range_ for the height of the bar, and use that to come up with a range for the area of the bar, and hence a range for the number of values in the bin. We can then use the fact that the number of values in a bin must be an integer to narrow down our answer.

- The height of the [5, 7) bar is less than 0.4. This means that the area of the [5, 7) bar is less than $(7 - 5) \cdot 0.4 = 0.8$, which means that the proportion of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"` is less than 0.8, and the number of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"` is less than $0.8 \cdot 32 = 25.6$.
- The height of the [5, 7) bar is a bit above 0.375, which is the midpoint between 0.35 and 0.4 on the $y$-axis. This means that the area of the [5, 7) bar is more than $(7 - 5) \cdot 0.375 = 0.75$, which means that the number of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"` is more than $0.75 \cdot 32 = 24$.

We've found that the number of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"` is more than 24 and less than 25.6. There is only one integer in this range – 25 – so the number of EVs with 5 or 6 `"Seats"` is 25. Finally, the number of EVs with exactly 5 seats is $25 - 3 = 22$.

Histogram C also displays the distribution of the `"Seats"` column, but uses just a single bin, [4, 9]. What is the height of the sole bar in Histogram C?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{5}$ (or 0.2)

Recall, the total area of a (density) histogram is 1. Since Histogram C only has one bar, the area of that one bar must be 1. we can use this fact to find what its height must be.

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Area} &= \text{Width} \cdot \text{Height} \\
1 &= (9 - 4) \cdot \text{Height} \\
\frac{1}{5} &= \text{Height}
\end{align*}$$
