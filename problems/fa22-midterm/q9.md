(3 pts) How many EVs in evs have exactly 6 seats?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** 3

There are two ways to solve this problem, the first way is easier.

Solution 1

Since the bin [6, 7) has a width of 1, its height is equal to its area, which is equal to the proportion of values in that bin. There are 32 values total, so the height must be a multiple of 1/32. The height is close to but just under 0.01; this implies the height is 3/32, since that is also close to but just under 0.01 (4/32 is way above, 2/32 is way below). So, we conclude that the number of EVs with 6 seats is 3.

Solution 2

We first calculate the proportion of EVs with 6 seats by computing the area between 6 seats and 7 seats in Histogram A (Recall, 6 is inclusive and 7 is exclusive). Since we are not sure about the height of this area, we can construct a range that the area will fall in.

The height is less than 0.1. Thus, Proportion of EVs with 6 seats < $0.1 \cdot 1 = 0.1$

The height is more than 0.75. Thus, Proportion of EVs with 6 seats > $0.075 \cdot 1 = 0.075$

We then calculate the number of EVs with 6 seats by multiplying its proportion with the total number of EVs in `evs`.

Number of EVs with 6 seats < $0.1 \cdot 32 = 3.2$

Number of EVs with 6 seats > $0.075 \cdot 32 = 2.4$

Thus, the number of EVs with 6 seats is an integer between 2.4 and 3.2, which is 3.

(4 pts) How many EVs in evs have exactly 5 seats?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** 22

We can compute this by calculating the total number of EVs with either 5 seats or 6 seats and subtract the number of EVs with 6 seats that we computed in part a, which gives us the number of EVs with 6 seats. 

First, we compute the total number of EVs with either 5 seats or 6 seats.

Proportion of EVs with either 5 seats or 6 seats = the area between 5 seats and 7 seats in Histogram B (Recall, 5 is inclusive and 7 is exclusive). Since we are not sure about the height of this area, we can construct a range that the area will fall in.

The height is less than 0.4. Thus, Proportion of EVs with 5 or 6 seats < $0.4 \cdot (7-5) = 0.8$

The height is more than 0.375 (There is a line between 0.35 and 0.4 on the y-axis, since it is at middle, we can compute that its value is $frac{(0.35+0.4)}{2}$ which gives us 0.375. Since our bar exceeds this line, its height should be larger than 0.375). Thus, Proportion of EVs with 5 or 6 seats > $0.375 \cdot (7-5) = 0.75$

We then calculate the number of EVs with 5 or 6 seats by multiplying its proportion with the total number of EVs in `evs`.

Number of EVs with 5 or 6 seats < $0.8 \cdot 32 = 25.6$

Number of EVs with 5 or 6 seats > $0.75 \cdot 32 = 24$

Thus, the number of EVs with 6 seats is an integer between 24 and 25.6 (exclusive), which is 25. Number of EVs with 6 seats = Number of EVs with 5 or 6 seats -  Number of EVs with 5 seats = $25 - 3 = 22$

(3pts) **Histogram C** (not pictured) also displays the distribution of the `"Seats"` column, but uses just a single bin, [4, 9]. What is the height of the sole bar in **Histogram C**?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** 0.2

Recall, a density histogram has the total area of 1. Since we only have one bin in this case, the area of the bin is 1. 

$$Area = height \cdot width$$

$$1 = height \cdot (9-4)$$

$$1 = height \cdot 5$$

$$height = 0.2$$
