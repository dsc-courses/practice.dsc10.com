# BEGIN PROB

Consider the following incomplete assignment statement.

```py
result = evs______.mean()
```

In each part, fill in the blank above so that result evaluates to the specified quantity.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A DataFrame, indexed by `"Brand"`, whose `"Seats"` column contains the average
number of `"Seats"` per `"Brand"`. (The DataFrame may have other columns in it as
well.)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `.groupby("Brand")`

When we group by a column, the resulting DataFrame contains one row for every unique value in that column. The question specified that we wanted some information _per_ `"Brand"`, which implies that grouping by `"Brand"` is necessary.

After grouping, we need to use an aggregation method. Here, we wanted the resulting DataFrame to be such that the `"Seats"` column contained the average number of `"Seats"` per `"Brand"`; this is accomplished by using `.mean()`, which is already done for us.

Note: With the provided solution, the resulting DataFrame also has other columns. For instance, it has a `"Range"` column that contains the average `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`. That's fine, since we were told that the resulting DataFrame may have other columns in it as well. If we wanted to ensure that the only column in the resulting DataFrame was `"Seats"`, we could have used `.get(["Brand", "Seats"])` before grouping, though this was not necessary.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A number, corresponding to the average `"TopSpeed"` of all EVs manufactured
by Audi in evs

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `[evs.get("Brand") == "Audi"].get("TopSpeed")`

There are two parts to this problem:

1. Querying, to make sure that we only keep the rows corresponding to Audis. This is accomplished by:

    - Using `evs.get("Brand") == "Audi"` to create a Boolean Series, with `True`s for the rows we want to keep and `False`s for the other rows.
    - Using Boolean indexing to keep only the rows in which the aforementioned Series is `True`. This is accomplished by `evs[evs.get("Brand") == "Audi"]` (though the `evs` part at the front was already provided).

2. Accessing the `"TopSpeed"` column. This is accomplished by using `.get("TopSpeed")`.

Then, `evs[evs.get("Brand") == "Audi"].get("TopSpeed")` is a Series contaning the `"TopSpeed"`s of all Audis, and mean of this Series is the result we're looking for. The call to `.mean()` was already provided for us.

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A number, corresponding to the average of the natural logarithm of the `"TopSpeed"`
of all EVs in evs. (Hint: The function `np.log` computes the natural logarithm of a
single number.)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `.get("TopSpeed").apply(np.log)`

The `.apply` method is used to apply a function on every element of a Series. The relevant Series here is the column containing the `"TopSpeed"` of each EV, i.e. `evs.get("TopSpeed")` (the `evs` part was already provided to us). 

After we get that Series, we need to use the function `np.log` on every element of it. This is accomplished by using `.apply(np.log)`. Putting our steps so far together, we have `evs.get("TopSpeed").apply(np.log)`, which is a Series containing the natural logarithm of the `"TopSpeed"` of all EVs in `evs`.

The number we were asked for was the average of the natural logarithm of the `"TopSpeed"` of all EVs in `evs`; all we need to do now is use the `.mean()` method at the end, which was already done for us.
