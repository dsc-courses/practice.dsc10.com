Which type of visualization should we use to visualize the distribution of `"Range"`?

( ) Bar Chart
( ) Histogram
( ) Scatter Plot
( ) Line Plot

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: Histogram ** 

To look at the distribution of `"Range"`, a Histogram is the best kind of visualization because we're looking at two quantitative values (frequency and range). A Bar chart wouldn't make sense here since we're not looking at categorical data vs quantitative data. And a scatter plot wouldn't make sense here since we're not looking at two variables (we're only looking the distribution of `"Range"`, which is just one variable). A line plot wouldn't work here either since we're not looking for a relationship between variables, just a distribution of values.

Teslas, on average, tend to have higher `"Range"`s than BMWs. In which of the following visualizations would we be able to see this pattern? Select all that apply.

[ ] A bar chart that shows the distribution of `"Brand"`
[ ] A bar chart that shows the average `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`
[ ] An overlaid histogram showing the distribution of `"Range"` for each `"Brand"`
[ ] A scatter plot with `"TopSpeed"` on the $x$-axis and `"Range"` on the $y$-axis

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: Options 2 and Options 3 ** 

Option 1: A bar chart showing the distribution of `"Brand"` would only show us how much of each `"Brand"` there is. It would not show us anything about the `"Range"` of each brand.

Option 2: A bar chart showing the average range for each `"Brand"` would help us directly visualize how the average range of each brand would compare to each other.

Option 3: An overlaid histogram, although perhaps a bit messy, would also give us a general idea of the average range of each brand by giving us the distribution of the range of each brand. (although we may have to do some estimation and eye-balling)

Option 4: A scatter plot of `"Top Speed"` against `"Range"` would only illustrate the relationship between `"Top Speed"` and `"Range"`, not anything about the average `"Range"` for each brand.

Gabriel thinks `"Seats"` is a categorical variable because it can be used to categorize EVs by size. For instance, EVs with 4 seats are small, EVs with 5 seats are medium, and EVs with 6 or more seats are large.

Is Gabriel correct?

( ) Yes
( ) No

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: No ** 

`"Seats"` is a numerical variable, since ** it makes sense to do arithmetic with it **. We can find the average number of seats that a group of cars has, for instance. Gabriel's argument could apply to any numerical variable; just because we can place numerical variables into "bins" doesn't make them categorical.
