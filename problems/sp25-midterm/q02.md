# BEGIN PROB

In `tariffs`, we use integers to represent percentages, but we could
also use strings with the percent symbol %. For example, the integer
`34` and the string `"34%"` both represent the same thing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the functions `with_percent_symbol` and `without_percent_symbol`
below. The function `with_percent_symbol` should take as input an
integer and give as output a string with the percent symbol. The
function `without_percent_symbol` should do the opposite. Example
behavior is given below.

```py
    >>>  with_percent_symbol(34)             
    "34%"    
    >>> without_percent_symbol("34%")
    34                       

    def with_percent_symbol(x):         
        return __(a)__                        

    def without_percent_symbol(x):
        return __(b)__  
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `str(x)+"%"`

<average>70</average>

**Answer (b):** `int(x.replace("%", ""))`

<average>79</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Define the variable `y` as follows.

```py
    y = tariffs.get("Reciprocal Tariff").apply(with_percent_symbol)
```

Below, define `z` so that it evaluates to exactly the same Series as
`y`. You may **not** use `with_percent_symbol` or `y` when defining `z`.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `z = tariffs.get("Reciprocal Tariff").apply(str) + "%"`

<average>33</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Determine the value of the following expression.
```py
    y.iloc[3] + " tax on goods from " + tariffs.get("Country").loc[3]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"32% tax on goods from Taiwan"`

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
