# BEGIN PROB

In `tariffs`, we use integers to represent percentages, but we could
also use strings with the percent symbol %. For example, the integer
`34` and the string `"34%"` both represent the same thing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the functions `with_percent_symbol` and `without_percent_symbol`
below. The function `with_percent_symbol` should take as input an
integer and give as output a string with the percent symbol. The
function `without_percent_symbol` should do the opposite. Example
behavior is given below.

```py
    >>>  with_percent_symbol(34)
    "34%"
    >>> without_percent_symbol("34%")
    34

    def with_percent_symbol(x):
        return __(a)__

    def without_percent_symbol(x):
        return __(b)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `str(x)+"%"`

In order to add a percent symbol to the end, we first need to convert the variable `x` from an integer into a string by casting it. From there we can add a `"%"` sign to `x` through concatenation.

<average>70</average>

**Answer (b):** `int(x.replace("%", ""))` or `int(x.strip("%"))`

In this case, the variable `x` is now a string with `"%"` at the end of it. Our first step is to get rid of the `"%"` at the end by either replacing it with an empty string `""`, or stripping it from the end. Note that the `.strip("%")` approach works because `"%"` is at the end of the string. If it were in the middle instead of the start or end, `.strip("%")` would not work. After we are left with only the number to cast to a string value for our output.

<average>79</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Define the variable `y` as follows.

```py
    y = tariffs.get("Reciprocal Tariff").apply(with_percent_symbol)
```

Below, define `z` so that it evaluates to exactly the same Series as
`y`. You may **not** use `with_percent_symbol` or `y` when defining `z`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `z = tariffs.get("Reciprocal Tariff").apply(str) + "%"`

The `Reciprocal Tariff` column consists of integer values. In order to add a percent sign ("%") to the end of each of these values, we must first convert the Series of integers into a Series of strings before we are able to concatenate each with the percent sign ("%").

<average>33</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Determine the value of the following expression.

```py
    y.iloc[3] + " tax on goods from " + tariffs.get("Country").loc[3]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"32% tax on goods from Taiwan"`

`y.iloc[3]` consists of the Reciprocal Tariff (as a string) corresponding to the fourth entry of the Series y. From the given DataFrame, the fourth row corresponds to a Reciprocal Tariff 32. Because y is a Series of strings that added the "%" sign to each Reciprocal Tariff, `y.iloc[3]` evaluates to the string "32%". `tariffs.get("Country").loc[3]` evaluates to the country at the fourth position from the `tariffs` DataFrame, or "Taiwan".

<average>88</average>
