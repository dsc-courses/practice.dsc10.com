The announcement of the tariffs affected many products, one
of which was the Nintendo Switch 2, a new video game console. Due to the
tariffs, preorders of the Nintendo Switch 2 were put on hold so pricing
could be reconsidered. In this problem, we'll imagine a scenario in
which Nintendo used this delay period to drum up excitement for their
new product.

Suppose Nintendo arranges a contest to give away `k` of their new Switch
2 consoles. The contest is open to anyone and `n` people participate,
with `n > k`. Everyone has an equal chance of winning, and nobody can
win more than once. Jason and Ray both enter the contest, and they want
to estimate the probability that they **both win**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `giveaway` so that it returns an
estimate of the probability that Jason and Ray both win a Switch 2, when
there are `n` participants and `k` prizes.

```py
    1 def giveaway(n, k):
    2     count = 0
    3     for i in np.arange(10000):
    4         winners = np.random.choice(___(a)___)
    5         if ___(b)___:
    6             count = count + 1
    7     return ___(c)___
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `np.arange(n), k, replace=False`

**Answer (b):** `0 in winners and 1 in winners` (can be any two numbers)

**Answer (c):** `count/10000`

<average>32</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

If you implement `giveaway` correctly, what should `giveaway(100, 100)`
evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `1.0`

<average>55</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you modify the `giveaway` function as follows:

-   Change line 2 to `results = np.array([])`.

-   Change line 6 to `results = np.append(results, "WIN!")`.

-   Leave lines 1, 3, 4, and 5 unchanged, including your code in blanks
    `(a)` and `(b)`.

Which of the following could be used to fill in blank `(c)`? Select all
that apply.

[ ] `len(results)/10000`           
[ ] `(results == "WIN!").sum()`    
[ ] `(results == "WIN!").mean()`   
[ ] `np.count_nonzero(results)`
[ ] `np.random.choice(results)`
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `len(results)/10000` and `(results == "WIN!").mean()`

<average>55</average>

# END SOLUTION
