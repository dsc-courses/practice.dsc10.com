# BEGIN PROB

The announcement of the tariffs affected many products, one
of which was the Nintendo Switch 2, a new video game console. Due to the
tariffs, preorders of the Nintendo Switch 2 were put on hold so pricing
could be reconsidered. In this problem, we'll imagine a scenario in
which Nintendo used this delay period to drum up excitement for their
new product.

Suppose Nintendo arranges a contest to give away `k` of their new Switch
2 consoles. The contest is open to anyone and `n` people participate,
with `n > k`. Everyone has an equal chance of winning, and nobody can
win more than once. Jason and Ray both enter the contest, and they want
to estimate the probability that they **both win**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `giveaway` so that it returns an
estimate of the probability that Jason and Ray both win a Switch 2, when
there are `n` participants and `k` prizes.

```py
    1 def giveaway(n, k):
    2     count = 0
    3     for i in np.arange(10000):
    4         winners = np.random.choice(___(a)___)
    5         if ___(b)___:
    6             count = count + 1
    7     return ___(c)___
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `np.arange(n), k, replace=False`

This makes sure that exactly k winners are chosen randomly from n participants without replacement, since no person can win more than once.

**Answer (b):** `0 in winners and 1 in winners` (can be any two numbers)

Assuming Jason and Ray are represented by IDs 0 and 1, this checks whether both of them are in the list of winners for that trial. However, because we never specify what number Jason and Ray are, you could use any two numbers (ie: `1 in winners and 2 in winners`)

**Answer (c):** `count/10000`

This computes the estimated probability as the fraction of trials where both Jason and Ray won out of 10,000 simulations.

<average>32</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

If you implement `giveaway` correctly, what should `giveaway(100, 100)`
evaluate to?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `1.0`

Since k is equal to n, everyone wins by default, meaning Jason and Ray will always be among the winners.

<average>55</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you modify the `giveaway` function as follows:

-   Change line 2 to `results = np.array([])`.

-   Change line 6 to `results = np.append(results, "WIN!")`.

-   Leave lines 1, 3, 4, and 5 unchanged, including your code in blanks
    `(a)` and `(b)`.

Which of the following could be used to fill in blank `(c)`? Select all
that apply.

[ ] `len(results)/10000`           
[ ] `(results == "WIN!").sum()`    
[ ] `(results == "WIN!").mean()`   
[ ] `np.count_nonzero(results)`
[ ] `np.random.choice(results)`
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `len(results)/10000`

- `len(results)/10000` calculates the proportion of trials that resulted in `"WIN!"`, which gives the probability. 

- `(results == "WIN!").mean()` does not work because every entry in `results` is `"WIN!"`. So this is taking the mean of an array filled with `True` values, so the mean is `1` all the time, regardless of how many times Jason and Ray win.

- `(results == "WIN!").sum()`: This counts the number of "WIN!" results but does not divide by 10000, so it gives a raw count, not a probability.

- `np.count_nonzero(results)`: This counts all non empty entries, but since results contains only "WIN!" strings, this is just len(results) and is equivalent to the raw count of wins, not the probability.

- `np.random.choice(results)`: This randomly picks an element from `results`. It is unrelated to calculating a probability and makes no sense in this context.
