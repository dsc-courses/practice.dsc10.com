Which country has the highest `"Reciprocal Tariff"`? Write one line of
code that evaluates to the name of this country.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `tariffs.sort_values(by="Reciprocal Tariff", ascending=False).get("Country").iloc[0]`
or
`tariffs.set_index("Country").sort_values(by= Reciprocal Tariff", ascending=False).index[0]`

To find the country with the highest "Reciprocal Tariff", we need to first sort `tariffs`  by the `"Reciprocal Tariff"` column in descending order: `tariffs.sort_values(by="Reciprocal Tariff", ascending=False)`. After sorting in descending order, we know that the country with the highest reciprocal tariff will be in the first row. Then, to get the name of this country, we select the `"Country"` column using `.get("Country")`. This gives us a Series of countries in order of descending reciprocal tariffs, and we can access the first value in this Series by using `.iloc[0]`. Note that if we sort in ascending order instead, we can use `.iloc[-1]` to access the last value in the Series.

Alternatively, since each country appears only once in `tariffs`, we can start by setting the `"Country"` column as the index: `tariffs.set_index("Country")`. Then, we sort the resulting DataFrame by the `"Reciprocal Tariff"` column in descending order, as explained above. Since the country names are now in the index, the first row of this sorted DataFrame will have the country with the highest reciprocal tariff as its index value, which we can access by using `.index[0]`. Note that if we sort in ascending order instead, we can use `.index[-1]` to access the last value in the index.
