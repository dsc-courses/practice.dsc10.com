Below is a density histogram displaying the distribution of reciprocal
tariffs for each of the 50 countries on Trump's chart. It was plotted
with the argument `bins=[10, 11, 15, 20, 40, 50]`.

Note that while the European Union is actually a group of many
countries, it is counted as one country here.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many countries have a reciprocal tariff of 10%?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $21$

Before attempting this problem, we must first understand how to interpret a 
density histogram. The x-axis represents the reciprocal tariff rate (in %), 
and the y-axis shows the density. The total area under the histogram sums to 1, 
with each bin corresponding to the proportion of countries falling within that bin.

The bins are defined as follows:

- [10, 11)
- [11, 15)
- [15, 20)
- [20, 40)
- [40, 50]

Countries with a reciprocal tariff of exactly 10% fall into the fist bin, [10, 11). 
The **width** of this bin is:

$$\text{width} = 11 - 10 = 1$$

Given that the **height** of the bin is 0.42, we calculate the **area** (i.e., 
the proportion of countries in this bin) using the formula:

$$\text{area} = \text{height} \times \text{width}$$
$$\text{area} = .42 \times 1$$
$$\text{area} = .42$$

This, 42% of the countries fall within the [10, 11) range. If there are 50 countries 
in total, we compute the number of countries in this bin as:

$$50 \times .42 = 21$$

So, **21 countries** have a reciprocal tariff rate between 10% and 11%. 

<average>82</average>

Suppose we plotted the same histogram, except we changed the `bins`
argument to `bins = [8, 15, 22, 30, 40, 50]`. What would be the height
of the **leftmost** bar in this histogram? Give your answer as a number
to two decimal places.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.06$

In this subproblem, we are told that the bins are changed. This time, instead 
of having a width of 1, the new bin has a width of 7 (15 - 8). 

Looking back at the histogram given, we note that there is no data in the 
interval [11, 15); all the data within this new, wider bin comes from the 
previous [10, 11) bin. 

We know the area is .42 as calculated in the prior subproblem, meaning all we 
have to do is recalculate the height using the changed width:

$$\text{area} = \text{height} \times \text{width}$$
$$.42 = \text{height} \times 7$$
$$\frac{.42}{7} = \text{height}$$
$$.06 = \text{height}$$

<average>52</average>

The European Union is not actually one country, but a group of 27
countries. Imagine we were to replace the row of `tariffs` corresponding
to the European Union with 27 rows representing each of the member
countries (all with a $20\%$ reciprocal tariff), then plot a histogram
of the reciprocal tariffs using `bins = [10, 11, 15, 20, 40, 50]`.

Let $h_{\text{new}}$ be the height of the **rightmost** bar in this
histogram, and let $h_{\text{old}}$ be the height of the rightmost bar
in the original histogram shown above. Express $h_{\text{new}}$ in terms
of $h_{\text{old}}$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $h_{\text{new}} = \frac{50}{76} \cdot h_{\text{old}}$

To solve this problem, we need to understand how modifying the dataset by replacing 
one row (The European Union) with 27 rows (each with a 20% reciprocal tariff) will 
affect the histogram: especially the **rightmost bin**, which is [40, 50]. 

In the original histograam, the number of total countries is 50. Now we can 
assume that the rightmost bin [40, 50] contains n countries. Since this is a 
**density histogram**, the **height** of a bin is given by:

$$\text{height} = \frac{\text{proportion of countries in bin}}{\text{width of bin}}$$

So, the **original height** of the rightmost bin is:

$$h_{\text{old}} = \frac{n}{50 \times 10}$$

Now, we change the dataset: instead of 50 countries, we now we have **76 countries** 
(because we're replacing 1 EU row with 27 separate rows, essentially adding 
**26, not 27** more entries).

The number of countries in the [40, 50] bin remains the same, in that none of 
the new EU entries fall into this bin (since they all have 20% tariff). However, 
the **total number of countries increases**, which affects the overall **proportion**. 

The new height becomes:
$$h_{\text{new}} = \frac{n}{76 \times 10}$$

Now, we divide the two to find $h_{\text{new}}$ in terms of $h_{\text{old}}$:

$$\frac{h_{\text{new}}}{h_{\text{old}}} = \frac{n / (76 \times 10)}{n / (50 \times 10)} = \frac{50}{76}$$

$$\therefore h_{\text{new}} = \frac{50}{76} \cdot h_{\text{old}}$$

<average>19</average>
