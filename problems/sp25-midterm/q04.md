Below is a density histogram displaying the distribution of reciprocal
tariffs for each of the 50 countries on Trump's chart. It was plotted
with the argument `bins=[10, 11, 15, 20, 40, 50]`.

Note that while the European Union is actually a group of many
countries, it is counted as one country here.

How many countries have a reciprocal tariff of 10%?

Suppose we plotted the same histogram, except we changed the `bins`
argument to `bins = [8, 15, 22, 30, 40, 50]`. What would be the height
of the **leftmost** bar in this histogram? Give your answer as a number
to two decimal places.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.06$

<average>52</average>

# END SOLUTION

The European Union is not actually one country, but a group of 27
countries. Imagine we were to replace the row of `tariffs` corresponding
to the European Union with 27 rows representing each of the member
countries (all with a $20\%$ reciprocal tariff), then plot a histogram
of the reciprocal tariffs using `bins = [10, 11, 15, 20, 40, 50]`.

Let $h_{\text{new}}$ be the height of the **rightmost** bar in this
histogram, and let $h_{\text{old}}$ be the height of the rightmost bar
in the original histogram shown above. Express $h_{\text{new}}$ in terms
of $h_{\text{old}}$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $h_{\text{new}} = \frac{50}{76} \cdot h_{\text{old}}$

<average>19</average>
