# BEGIN PROB

Trump's administration set the reciprocal tariffs based on tariffs
charged to the USA.

For each country in `tariffs`, the value in the `"Reciprocal Tariff"`
column is simply half of the value in the `"Tariffs Charged to USA"`
column, rounded **up** to the next integer.

In addition, if the `"Tariffs Charged to USA"` is less than $20$
percent, then the `"Reciprocal Tariff"` is set to $10$ percent, so that
no country's reciprocal tariff is ever less than $10$ percent.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `reciprocate` which takes as input an
integer representing the tariffs charged to the USA by a country, and
returns an integer representing the reciprocal tariff that the US will
impose on that country.

```py
    def reciprocate(charged):
        half = int((charged + 1) / 2)
        if __(a)__:
            return __(b)__
        else:
            return __(c)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `charged < 20` or `charged <= 20` or `half < 10` or `half <= 10`

**Answer (b):** `10`

**Answer (c):** `half`

Fill in the return statement of the function `reciprocate_2` which
behaves the same as `reciprocate` but is implemented differently. You
may **not** call the `reciprocate` function.

```py
    def reciprocate_2(charged):
        return __(d)__
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (d):** `max(int((charged + 1)/2), 10)`

The key to solving this question lies in understanding how Python’s max function works. The function takes an input called charged, adds 1 to it, and divides the result by 2, rounding down using int(). This gives a baseline number. However, since there's a constraint that the result should never be less than 10, we use max to return the larger of the two values: either the computed number or 10. This ensures the final result is always at least 10.

Define the variable `ch` as follows.

```py
    ch = tariffs.get("Tariffs Charged to USA")
```

You want to check that `reciprocate` and `reciprocate_2` give the same
outputs on all inputs in `ch`. Write an expression that evaluates to
`True` if this is the case, and `False` otherwise.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `(ch.apply(reciprocate) == ch.apply(reciprocate_2)).sum() == 50`

This question was a bit tricky! While it might seem sufficient to check `ch.apply(reciprocate) == ch.apply(reciprocate_2)`, that actually returns a Series of boolean values—one for each row—rather than a single True/False result. To properly verify that the functions behave identically, you need to sum the `True` values and compare that sum to the total number of rows in `ch`.
