# BEGIN PROB

Most imported goods are transported to the US in shipping containers.
The table to below shows the probability that a randomly selected
shipping container comes from a given location (continent or country).
Note that the probability for each continent is the sum of the
probabilities for each country in that continent.

For all parts of this question, you can leave your answer as an
**unsimplified mathematical expression.**

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you randomly select **one** shipping container. You are told
that it comes from Asia but not from Japan. What is the probability that
it comes from China?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{0.14}{0.36}=\frac{7}{18}$

<average>53</average>
