# BEGIN PROB

Most imported goods are transported to the US in shipping containers.
The table to below shows the probability that a randomly selected
shipping container comes from a given location (continent or country).
Note that the probability for each continent is the sum of the
probabilities for each country in that continent.

For all parts of this question, you can leave your answer as an
**unsimplified mathematical expression.**

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you randomly select **one** shipping container. You are told
that it comes from Asia but not from Japan. What is the probability that
it comes from China?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\frac{0.14}{0.36}=\frac{7}{18}$

<average>53</average>

**True or False**: Selecting a shipping container from Vietnam and selecting
a shipping container from Ireland are independent events.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** False

If two events A and B are independent then P(A and B) = P(A)P(B). In this question we can define A as "selecting a shipping container from Vietnam" and B as "selecting a shipping container from Ireland". Therefore (A and B) would be "selecting a (single) shipping container from both Vietnam and Ireland". Since that is impossible, P(A and B) = 0 while P(A)P(B) = 0.012. Therefore these two events are **not** independent. 

<average>32</average>

Suppose you randomly select **two** shipping containers, with
replacement. What is the probability that exactly one comes from Germany
and the other comes from somewhere in North America?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.03$

The probability of selecting Germany as the first shipping container is 0.05. Given that Germany is selected first, the probability that the second container is from the United States is 0.3. However, since the order of the containers can be swapped, you need to multiply by 2 to account for both possible arrangements.

<average>46</average>

Suppose you randomly select **three** shipping containers, with
replacement. What is the probability that none of them comes from Asia?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $0.59^{3}$

<average>42</average>
