Suppose we have another DataFrame called `trade_partners` that has a row
for every country that the United States trades with. `trade_partners`
is indexed by `"Country"` and has two columns:

-   The `"Proportion"` column contains `float`s representing the
    proportion of US imports coming from each country.

-   The `"Continent"` column contains the name of the continent where
    the country is located.

All countries in `tariffs` are included in `trade_partners` (including
`"European Union"`), but not all countries in `trade_partners` are
included in `tariffs`. The first three rows of `trade_partners` are
shown below.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write one line of code to merge `tariffs` with `trade_partners` and
store the result in `merged`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `merged = tariffs.merge(trade_partners, left_on="Country", right_index=True)`

`tariffs` and `trade_partners` are both dataframes which correspond to the US's relationship with other Countries. Since both dataframes contain one row for each country we need to merge them with the column which corresponds to the country name. In `tariffs` that would be the `Country` column and in `trade_partners` that is the index.

How many rows does `merged` have?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $50$

Since each DataFrame has exactly one row per country, the merged result will also have one row for every country they share. And because every country in `tariffs` appears in `trade_partners` (though not vice versa), the merged DataFrame will contain exactly as many rows as there are countries in `tariffs` (which is 50).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In which of the following DataFrames does the `"Proportion"` column sum
to $1$? Select all that apply.

[ ] `trade_partners`
[ ] `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").mean()`
[ ] `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").sum()`
[ ] `merged`
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `trade_partners` and `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").sum()`

Solving this problem is best done by working through each answer choice and eliminating the incorrect ones. In the problem statement, we are told that the `Proportion` column contains floats representing the proportion of US imports coming from each country. Since the `Proportion` column contains proportions, the sum of that column should equal one. Therefore, the first answer choice is a correct option. Moving on to the second choice, grouping by the continent and taking the mean proportion of each continent results in the proportion column containing mean proportions of groups. Since we are no longer working with all of the proportions and instead averages, we can not guarantee the sum of the `Proportion` column is one. However, because the third answer choice takes the sum of the proportions in each Continent, all of the proportions are still accounted for. As a result, the sum of the proportions column in the new dataframe would still add to one. Finally, as we determined in the previous part of the question, the `merged` dataframe contains all of the rows in `tariffs`, but not all of the rows in `trade_partners`. Per the problem description the rows in the `Proportion` column of `trade_partners` should sum to one, since some of those rows are omitted in `merged`, it is impossible for the `Proportion` column in merged to sum to one.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write one line of code that would produce an appropriate data
visualization showing the **median reciprocal tariff for each
continent**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `merged.groupby("Continent").median().plot(kind="barh", y="Reciprocal Tariff");`

This question calls for a visualization which shows the median reciprocal tariff for each continent. The first part of solving this problem involves correctly identifying what dataframe to use when plotting the data. In this case, the problem asks for a link between `Reciprocal Tariff`, a column in the `tariffs` dataframe, and `Continent`, a column in the `trade_partners` dataframe. Therefore, the `merged` dataframe must be used to create the plot. Within the `merged` dataframe, the question calls for median reciprocal tariffs for each continent. Currently, the `merged` dataframe has one row for each country rather than continent. Thus, before plotting the data, the `merged` dataframe must be grouped by `Continent` and aggregated by the `median()` to get the median `Reciprocal Tariff` for each continent. From there, all that is left is plotting the data. Since there exists one categorical variable, `Continent`, and one numerical variable, `Reciprocal Tariff`, a bar chart is appropriate here. Finally, because the dataframe is already indexed by continent after the groupby statement, all that needs to be specified within the `plot` function is the y variable, in this case, `Reciprocal Tariff`.
