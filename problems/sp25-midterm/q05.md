Suppose we have another DataFrame called `trade_partners` that has a row
for every country that the United States trades with. `trade_partners`
is indexed by `"Country"` and has two columns:

-   The `"Proportion"` column contains `float`s representing the
    proportion of US imports coming from each country.

-   The `"Continent"` column contains the name of the continent where
    the country is located.

All countries in `tariffs` are included in `trade_partners` (including
`"European Union"`), but not all countries in `trade_partners` are
included in `tariffs`. The first three rows of `trade_partners` are
shown below.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write one line of code to merge `tariffs` with `trade_partners` and
store the result in `merged`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `merged = tariffs.merge(trade_partners, left_on="Country", right_index=True)`

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many rows does `merged` have?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $50$

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In which of the following DataFrames does the `"Proportion"` column sum
to $1$? Select all that apply.

[ ] `trade_partners`
[ ] `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").mean()`
[ ] `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").sum()`
[ ] `merged`
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `trade_partners` and `trade_partners.groupby("Continent").sum()`

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write one line of code that would produce an appropriate data
visualization showing the **median reciprocal tariff for each
continent**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `merged.groupby("Continent").median().plot(kind="barh", y="Reciprocal Tariff");`

<average>68</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
