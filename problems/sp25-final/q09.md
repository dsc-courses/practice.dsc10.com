Before getting selected for the Hunger Games, Katniss often spent her
days hunting with her friend Gale. Hunting is illegal in Panem, so
Katniss and Gale sold their poached game at a black market known as The
Hob, always splitting the profits equally, even if one person's kills
were worth more than the other's.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose Katniss and Gale hunted together three times. The values of each
person's kills are recorded in `katniss_sample` and `gale_sample`,
respectively. Their individual profits are recorded in `average_sample`.
Calculate the mean and variance of each of these three samples. Give all
of your answers as integers.

  **Sample**                         **  Mean  **   **Variance**
  --------------------------------- -------------- --------------
  `katniss_sample = [47, 44, 50]`                  
  `gale_sample = [25, 28, 28]`                     
  `average_sample = [36, 36, 39]`

Suppose that the value of Katniss's kills are normally distributed with
mean $\$50$ and SD $\$3$, and the value of Gale's kills are
independently normally distributed with mean $\$30$ and SD $\$2$.

On one hunting trip, Katniss's kills are worth twice as much as Gale's,
but the value of her kills in standard units is the same as the value of
Gale's kills in standard units. Determine the value of Gale's kills on
this hunting trip. Give your answer as an integer.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Now, suppose that we no longer know whether the distribution of the
value of Katniss's kills is normal. All we know about this distribution
is that it has mean $\$50$ and SD $\$3$.

Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

[ ] It is possible that Katniss's kills are never valued between $\$48$ and $\$52$.

[ ] No more than $75\%$ of Katniss's kills are between $\$44$ and $\$56$ in value.

[ ] `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(50)` gives an approximation for the fraction of Katniss's kills that are below $\$50$ in value.

[ ] None of these.
