In certain districts ($1$, $2$, and $4$), children spend years training
for the Hunger Games and frequently volunteer to participate in them.
Tributes that come from these districts are known as **Career
tributes**. Many residents of Panem believe that Career tributes
generally fare better in the Hunger Games because of their extensive
training.

We'll test this claim using historical data. The DataFrame `survival`
has a row for each tribute who participated in one of the first $74$
Hunger Games. The columns are as follows:

-   `"Tribute"`: The name of the tribute.

-   `"District"`: Their home district ($1$--$12$).

-   `"Days"`: The number of days they stayed alive in the arena.

-   `"Game"`: The Hunger Games edition they competed in ($1$--$74$).

A few rows of `survival` are shown below:

We'll use this data to test the following pair of hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: On average, Career tributes and non-Career
    tributes survive an equal amount of time in the arena.\

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: On average, Career tributes survive
    **longer** in the arena than non-Career tributes.

Our test statistic will be the mean survival time of Career tributes
minus the mean survival time of non-Career tributes

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Write code to create a DataFrame called `tributes` that has all the data
in `survival` plus an additional column called `"Career"`. This column
should contain boolean values indicating whether each tribute is
considered a Career tribute. Feel free to define intermediate variables
and functions as needed, and to do this in multiple lines of code.

return False tributes =
survival.assign(Career=survival.get('District').apply(is_career))

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `statistics` evaluates to
an array with 10000 simulated values of the test statistic under the
null hypothesis.

```py
statistics = np.array([])

for i in np.arange(10000):
    shuffled = tributes.assign(__(a)__)
    means = shuffled.groupby("Career").mean().get("Days")
    stat = __(b)__
    statistics = np.append(statistics, stat)
```

`(a)`:

`(b)`:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The output of `tributes.groupby("Career").mean()` is shown below.

Fill in the blank below to compute the p-value of this test.

```py
p_value = (__(a)__).mean()
