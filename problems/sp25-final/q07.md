During the Hunger Games, sponsors may purchase supplies for the tributes
competing. However, supplies increase in price as the Hunger Games
progress. Haymitch collects data on the price, in dollars, of purchasing
bread for a tribute over the first $15$ days of the Hunger Games
competition. He uses linear regression to predict the price of bread
based on the day of the competition. His regression line is shown below
on a scatterplot of the data.

What conclusions can Haymitch draw from looking at the residual plot of his regression line? Select all that apply.

[ ] The correlation coefficient between these variables is weak ($r<0.5$).

[ ] A line is not the best choice to model the relationship between these variables.

[ ] There is a different line that fits the data better than this line.

[ ] None of the above.

Haymitch wants to present the scatter plot to potential sponsors, but he
wants to give the prices in thousands of dollars instead of dollars. He
divides each of the $15$ prices in his data set by $1000$, then
recalculates the regression line. Which of the following statements are
correct? Select all that apply.

[ ] The mean of the prices will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] The standard deviation of the prices will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting price from day will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] The intercept of the regression line predicting price from day will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting price in standard units from day in standard units will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] The root mean square error (RMSE) of the regression line will be divided by $1000$.

[ ] None of the above.
