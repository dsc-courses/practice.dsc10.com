So far, we have seen one way that children have tickets entered into the
reaping: they receive one ticket when they are $12$ years old, and then
each year thereafter, an additional ticket is added onto the previous
year's total. This means $13$-year-olds have two tickets, $14$-year-olds
have three tickets, and so on. We'll call these tickets **age tickets**.

In this problem only, we'll consider another way that a child may
*choose* to enter tickets into the reaping in addition to the mandatory
age tickets. If a child wishes, they can guarantee food rations for
their family members, including themselves, at the price of **one ticket
per person**. We'll call these tickets **food tickets**. Like age
tickets, food tickets are compounded each year, adding onto last year's
total.

As an example, let's calculate the number of tickets that Katniss
Everdeen has entered into the drawing at the reaping. Katniss is $16$
years old, and every year, she has bought food for 3 family members
(herself, her mother, and her sister Prim). This means:

-   At age $12$, Katniss had one age ticket and three food tickets,
    making $4$ tickets total.

-   At age $13$, Katniss had one age ticket and three food tickets **in
    addition to** the $4$ tickets from the year before, making $8$
    tickets total.

-   At age $14$, Katniss again had one age ticket and three food tickets
    **in addition to** the $8$ tickets from the year before, making $12$
    tickets total.

This pattern continues, and by the time Katniss is $16$, she has $20$
tickets.

In other words, Katniss had $4$ tickets entered when she was $12$ years,
and $4$ more with each passing year. The array `np.arange(4, 24, 4)`
contains the number of tickets Katniss entered each year, starting at
age $12$, up to and including her current age of $16$ years old.

Fill in the blanks below to define the function `tix_array` which takes
in a child's current `age` between $12$ and $18$ (inclusive) and a
number of family members, `k`. The function returns an array similar
Katniss's array above, representing the number of tickets they entered
into the reaping each year since they were $12$ years old, assuming that
they buy food for their whole family every year.

**Tip:** `tix_array(16, 3)` should be the same as the array
`np.arange(4, 24, 4)`.

```py
def tix_array(age, k):
    return np.arange(__(a)__, __(b)__, __(c)__)
```

`(a)`: `(b)`: `(c)`:

The DataFrame `reaping` contains information on the children of District
12 between the ages of $12$ and $18$. For each child, we have their
`"name"`, `"age"`, `"family_size"` which includes themselves, and a
boolean variable `"buying_food"`. A value of `True` means the child
always buys food for their entire family, and `False` means the child
never buys food for anyone. The first few rows of `reaping` are shown
below, but there are many more rows than pictured.

Fill in the blanks in the code below to add a new column, `"tickets"`,
to `reaping` that contains the number of tickets that the child will
have entered into the drawing in the current year.

**Hint:** In Python, `True` is treated as $1$ and `False` is treated as
$0$ when doing arithmetic!

```py
tickets_per_year = __(d)__ * __(e)__ + 1
current_tickets = tickets_per_year * (__(f)__)
reaping = reaping.assign(tickets = current_tickets)
```

`(d)`: `(e)`: `(f)`:

For this subpart, assume that the `tix_array` function was defined
correctly in part $(a)$, and that the `"tickets"` column was added
correctly to the `reaping` DataFrame in part $(b)$. Fill in the blanks
in the code below so that the following expression evaluates to `True`.

```py
reaping.get("tickets").iloc[7] == tix_array(__(g)__, __(h)__)[-1]
```

`(g)`: `(h)`:
