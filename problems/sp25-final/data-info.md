*The Hunger Games* is a young adult dystopian fictional novel. The events take place in the future in the fictional country of Panem, which consists of 12 impoverished districts and a wealthy metropolitan area called the Capitol.

The plot centers around an annual televised competition called the Hunger Games, in which children from the districts are forced to compete in a battle to the death. The participants, called tributes, are randomly selected via a lottery system. 

The competition takes place in an arena that is specially designed for this purpose, and usually lasts several days or weeks, until only one tribute survives. The entire event is turned into a spectacle, which is broadcast throughout Panem as a way for the oppressive government to remind district residents of their powerlessness. 

The main character and protagonist of *The Hunger Games* is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year old girl from District 12 who competes in the 74th annual Hunger Games. After a life of poverty and near starvation, her experience in the Hunger Games arena further fuels her hatred of the government and lights a fire in her to fight back against the oppression.
