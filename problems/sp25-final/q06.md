Residents of Panem not participating in the Hunger Games can sponsor
tributes to help them survive. Sponsors purchase supplies and have them
delivered to tributes in the arena via parachute. Haymitch is the mentor
for the tributes from District 12, Katniss and Peeta. Part of his job is
to recruit sponsors to buy necessary supplies for Katniss and Peeta
while they are in the arena.

In his advertising to potential sponsors, Haymitch claims that in 100
randomly selected parachutes delivered to tributes in past Hunger Games,
the supplies were distributed into categories as follows:

::: center
**Haymitch's Distribution**\

  **Category**   Medical   Food   Weapons   Shelter   Other   **Total**
  -------------- --------- ------ --------- --------- ------- -----------
  **Count**      $40$      $30$   $10$      $15$      $5$     $100$
:::



Data scientists at the Capitol know that across all past Hunger Games,
there have been 2000 parachute deliveries of supplies to tributes.
Further, they have recorded the following count of how many of these
parachutes' supplies fell into each category:



::: center
**The Capitol's Distribution**\

  **Category**   Medical   Food    Weapons   Shelter   Other   **Total**
  -------------- --------- ------- --------- --------- ------- -----------
  **Count**      $700$     $500$   $300$     $300$     $200$   $2000$

In this problem, we will assess whether Haymitch is making an accurate
claim by determining whether his sample of 100 parachutes looks like a
random sample from the Capitol's distribution.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following are appropriate test statistics for this hypothesis test? Select all that apply.

[ ] The mean difference in proportions between Haymitch's distribution and the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] The maximum absolute difference in proportions between Haymitch's distribution and the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] The average absolute difference in proportions between Haymitch' distribution and the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] The sum of squared differences in proportions between Haymitch's distribution and the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] The correlation coefficient between Haymitch's proportion and the Capitol's proportion, for each category.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Choices 2,3,4

The underlying question we are asking in this problem is are the two distributions the same. That being said, it means that directionality does not matter. This eliminates any answer choice that takes solely the difference without accounting for the lack of directionality. As a result, we eliminate choices 1 and 5. Choice 1 takes a simple difference and Choice 5 calculates a correlation coefficient which does not apply when looking at whether two distributions are the same. We are left with choices 2,3,4. All of these choices account for the lack of directionality required by our question, but contain slight differences in the choice of summary statistic used.

Suppose we decide to use total variation distance (TVD) as the test
statistic for this hypothesis test. Calculate the TVD between Haymitch's
distribution and the Capitol's distribution. Give your answer as an
exact decimal.

::: center

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.1

To find the TVD here, we first have turn each set of counts into proportions by dividing by their totals. Then for each one fo the categories we have to find the absolute difference between Haymitch's proportion and the Capitol's proportion. When we add these differences and divide by 2 we get 0.1. This is our TVD, and it cane be interpretted as there being a 10% difference between the two distributions

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you run a simulation to generate 1000 TVDs between the Capitol's
distribution and samples of size 100 randomly drawn from that
distribution. You determine that the TVD you calculated in part $(b)$ is
in the 96th percentile of your simulated TVDs. Which of the following
correctly interprets this result? Select all that apply.

[ ] About 96% of simulated TVDs are less than the one you calculated in part $(b)$.
[ ] Haymitch's distribution is 96% more accurate than the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] There is a 96% probability that Haymitch's sample was a random sample from the Capitol's distribution.
[ ] If Haymitch's sample were a random sample from the Capitol's distribution, getting a TVD greater than or equal to the one you calculated in part $(b)$ would happen about 4% of the time.
[ ] If Haymitch's sample were a random sample from the Capitol's distribution, getting a TVD greater than or equal to the one you calculated in part $(b)$ would happen about 96% of the time.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Choice 1 & Choice 4

Choice 1 is correct because being in the 96th percentile essentially means that about 96% of the TVDs we simulted are smaller than the one we observed. 

Choice 2 is incorrect because when we calculate the percentile, it doesn't measure accuracy, it instead is a simple measure of how our TVD compares to the simulated ones. 

Choice 3 is also incorrect because the percentile we calculate here is no the same as the probability the null hypothesis is true. 

Choice 4 is a correct choice because if Haymitch's sample really came from the Capitol's distribution, only about 4% of those random samples would have a TVD that is either equal to the one we found or larger.

Choice 5 is the last answer choice and is also incorrect because it reverses the definition of the percentile. This choice would be correct had it said 4% not 96%.
