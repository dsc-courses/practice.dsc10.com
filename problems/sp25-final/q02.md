# BEGIN PROB

As we saw in the last problem, children aged $12$ to $18$ (inclusive)
have tickets entered into a drawing at the reaping. $12$-year-olds have
one ticket, $13$-year-olds have two tickets, $14$-year-olds have three
tickets, and so on, gaining one ticket per year of age.

In this problem, we'll look at the ages of all boys from District $3$
and determine the probability that a boy of a certain age is selected in
the drawing.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that there are only five boys from District $3$ and their ages
are as follows (in no particular order):

::: center
$17, 12, 15, 14, 12$.
:::

Determine the probability that a $17$-year-old is selected in the
drawing.

Give your answer as an **unsimplified fraction** where the numerator is
the number of tickets corresponding to a $17$-year-old and the
denominator is the total number of tickets.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Now, we'll solve the problem more generally. Fill in the blanks below to
define a function `pick_prob` that takes as input an array containing
the ages of all boys in District $3$, and a single age between $12$ and
$18$ (inclusive). The function should return the probability of randomly
selecting a boy of that age during the reaping.

```py
def pick_prob(ages, one_age):
    age_tickets = __(a)__
    total_tickets = __(b)__
    return age_tickets / total_tickets
```

`(a)`: `(b)`:

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Using `pick_prob`, write one line of code that evaluates to the
probability that a $14$-year-old boy is **not chosen** during the
reaping if the boys in District $3$ are aged $12$, $14$, $14$, $15$,
$17$, and $18$.
