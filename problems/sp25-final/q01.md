In an annual ceremony known as the reaping, tributes are selected to
represent their district in the Hunger Games. One male and one female
tribute from each district are randomly selected via a lottery drawing.

Every child between the ages of $12$ and $18$ (inclusive) has tickets
entered into the drawing for their sex and district (e.g. girls from
District $12$). The number of tickets entered is dependent on age.

Starting at age $12$, each child receives one ticket in the lottery. For
each year after that, they receive one additional ticket, added to the
total from the previous year. For example, $13$-year-olds have two
tickets, $14$-year-olds have three tickets, and so on.

In this problem, we will consider only tickets corresponding to girls
from District $12$, and look at the distribution of these tickets
according to the age of the person they represent. A density histogram
for these tickets is shown below.

Which of the following statements about this distribution is correct?

( ) The mean is less than the median.
( ) The mean is the same as the median.
( ) The mean is greater than the median.

the median with the given information.

Suppose the rules of the Hunger Games were changed to eliminate
$18$-year-olds. If we plotted a new density histogram of the
distribution of ages for tickets corresponding to girls from District
$12$ aged $12$ to $17$, how would the height of the `[13, 14)` bar
change?

Let $h$ be the height of this bar in the original histogram. Give its
height in the new histogram in terms of $h$.

What is the **most common age** among girls from District 12 aged $12$
to $18$? Remember, the distribution above is for all tickets, and older
girls have more tickets.

( ) 12 ( ) 13 ( ) 14 ( ) 15 ( ) 16 ( ) 17 ( ) 18
