After being selected at the reaping, tributes are transported to the
Capitol to prepare for the Hunger Games. While they are there, they
attend a training camp to practice skills that might be helpful in the
arena. At the training camp, there are 8 different stations such as
camouflage, knife throwing, archery, plant identification, etc. At each
of the 8 stations, tributes are scored on their skills from 1 to 10.

These 8 scores are combined into an overall score as follows:

-   Count the number of stations at which the tribute scored **more than
    5**, demonstrating basic proficiency.

-   Count the number of stations at which the tribute scored **more than
    8**, demonstrating expertise.

-   Add these counts together, capping the overall score at 12. This
    means that if the sum is larger than 12, the tribute earns the
    maximum possible score of 12.

Overall scores therefore range from 0 to 12. Which of the following
functions takes as input an array containing a tribute's 8 scores from
the stations and correctly outputs their overall score? Select all that
apply.

**Hint:** In Python, `True + True` evaluates to `2`.
