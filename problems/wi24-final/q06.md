# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we sample **400 rows** of `olympians` at random without
replacement, then generate a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the
mean age of Olympic medalists based on this sample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The CLT is stated for samples drawn with replacement, but in practice,
we can often use it for samples drawn without replacement. What is it
about this situation that makes it reasonable to still use the CLT
despite the sample being drawn without replacement?

( ) The sample is much smaller than the population.
( ) The statistic is the sample mean.
( ) The CLT is less computational than bootstrapping, so we don't need to sample with replacement like we would for bootstrapping.
( ) The population is normally distributed.
( ) The sample standard deviation is similar to the population standard deviation.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>47</average>

Suppose our 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the mean age of
Olympic medalists is $[24.9, 26.1]$. What was the mean and standard
deviation of ages in our sample?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Mean = 

<average>90</average>

**Answer:** Standard deviation = 

<average>55</average>
