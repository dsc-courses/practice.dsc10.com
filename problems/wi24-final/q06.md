Suppose we sample **400 rows** of `olympians` at random without
replacement, then generate a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the
mean age of Olympic medalists based on this sample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The CLT is stated for samples drawn with replacement, but in practice,
we can often use it for samples drawn without replacement. What is it
about this situation that makes it reasonable to still use the CLT
despite the sample being drawn without replacement?

( ) The sample is much smaller than the population.
( ) The statistic is the sample mean.
( ) The CLT is less computational than bootstrapping, so we don't need to sample with replacement like we would for bootstrapping.
( ) The population is normally distributed.
( ) The sample standard deviation is similar to the population standard deviation.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** The sample is much smaller than the population.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is sufficiently large. The key factor that makes it reasonable to still use the CLT, is the sample size relative to the population size. When the sample size is much smaller than the population size, as in this case where 400 rows of Olympians are sampled from a likely much larger population of Olympians, the effect of sampling without replacement becomes negligible.

Suppose our 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the mean age of
Olympic medalists is $[24.9, 26.1]$. What was the mean of ages in our sample? 

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Mean = 25.5

We calculate the mean by first determining the width of our interval: 26.1 - 24.9 = 1.2, then we divide this width in half to get 0.6 which represents the distance from the mean to each side of the confidence interval. Using this we can find the mean in two ways: 24.9 + 0.6 = 25.5 OR 26.1 - 0.6 = 25.5.

Suppose our 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the mean age of
Olympic medalists is $[24.9, 26.1]$. What was the standard deviation of ages in our sample?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Standard deviation = 6

We can calculate the sample standard deviation (sample SD) by using the 95% confidence interval equation:   

$\text{sample mean} - 2 * \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}, \text{sample mean} + 2 * \frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{\text{sample size}}}$. 

Choose one of the end points and start plugging in all the information you have/calculated:  

$25.5 - 2*\frac{\text{sample SD}}{\sqrt{400}} = 24.9$ &rarr; $\text{sample SD} = \frac{(25.5 - 24.9)}{2}*\sqrt{400} = 6$.
