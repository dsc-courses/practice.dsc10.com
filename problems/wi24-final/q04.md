The Olympics are held every two years, in even-numbered years,
alternating between the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics. Summer
Olympics are held in years that are a **multiple of 4** (such as 2024),
and Winter Olympics are held in years that are not a multiple of 4 (such
as 2022 or 2026).

We want to add a column to `olympics` that contains either `"Winter"` or
`"Summer"` by applying a function called `season` as follows:
```py
    olympians.assign(Season=olympians.get("Year").apply(season))
```

Which of the following definitions of `season` is correct? Select all
that apply.

*Notes:*

-   We'll ignore the fact that the 2020 Olympics were rescheduled to
    2021 due to Covid.

-   Recall that the `%` operator in Python gives the remainder upon
    division. For example, `8 % 3` evaluates to `2`.

Way 1:
```py
        def season(year):
            if year % 4 == 0:
                return "Summer"
            return "Winter"
```

Way 2:
```py
        def season(year):
            return "Winter"
            if year % 4 == 0:
                return "Summer"
```

Way 3:
```py
        def season(year):
            if year % 2 == 0:
                return "Winter"
            return "Summer"
```
Way 4:
```py
        def season(year):
            if int(year / 4) != year / 4:
                return "Winter"
            return "Summer"
```
