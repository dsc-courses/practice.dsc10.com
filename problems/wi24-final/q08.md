In Olympic hockey, the number of goals a team scores is linearly
associated with the number of shots they attempt. In addition, the
number of goals a team scores has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation
of 5, whereas the number of attempted shots has a mean of 30 and a
standard deviation of 10.

Suppose the regression line to predict the number of goals based on the
number of shots predicts that for a game with 20 attempted shots, 6
goals will be scored. What is the correlation between the number of
goals and the number of attempted shots? Give your answer as an exact
fraction or decimal.

In Olympic baseball, the number of runs a team scores is linearly
associated with the number of hits the team gets. The number of runs a
team scores has a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 4, while the
number of hits has a mean of 24 and a standard deviation of 6. Consider
the regression line that predicts the number of runs scored based on the
number of hits.

1.  What is the maximum possible predicted number of runs for a team
    that gets 27 hits?


2.  What is the correlation coefficient in the case where the predicted
    number of runs for a team with 25 hits is as large as possible?
