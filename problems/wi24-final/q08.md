In Olympic hockey, the number of goals a team scores is linearly
associated with the number of shots they attempt. In addition, the
number of goals a team scores has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation
of 5, whereas the number of attempted shots has a mean of 30 and a
standard deviation of 10.

Suppose the regression line to predict the number of goals based on the
number of shots predicts that for a game with 20 attempted shots, 6
goals will be scored. What is the correlation between the number of
goals and the number of attempted shots? Give your answer as an exact
fraction or decimal.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{4}{5}$

Recall that the formula of the regression line in standard units is $y_{su}=r \cdot x_{su}$. Since we are predicting # of goals from the # of shots, let $x_{su}$ represent # of shots in standard units and $y_{su}$ represent # of goals in standard units. Using the formula for standard units with information in the problem, we find $x_{su}=\frac{20-30}{10}=(-1)$ and $y_{su}=\frac{6-10}{5}=(-\frac{4}{5})$. Hence, $(-\frac{4}{5})=r \cdot (-1)$ and $r=\frac{4}{5}$.

In Olympic baseball, the number of runs a team scores is linearly
associated with the number of hits the team gets. The number of runs a
team scores has a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 4, while the
number of hits has a mean of 24 and a standard deviation of 6. Consider
the regression line that predicts the number of runs scored based on the
number of hits.

1.  What is the maximum possible predicted number of runs for a team
    that gets 27 hits?


2.  What is the correlation coefficient in the case where the predicted
    number of runs for a team with 25 hits is as large as possible?


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** i) 10

Consider the standard unit regression line again, $y_{su}=r \cdot x_{su}$. Since we are predicting # of runs from the # of hits, let xsu represent # of hits in standard units and ysu represent # of runs in standard units. In part b, we are hoping to find the maximal $y_{su}$ given the $x_{su}$. Via formula for standard units, we know $x_{su}=\frac{27-24}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because $x_{su}$ is positive, we know that to achieve the maximum prediction in $y_{su}$, the correlation r must also be positive and its largest possible value. Since the value of r must be between -1 and 1, we know that to satisfy the prior condition, r=1. Plugging everything back, we find that $y_{su}=1 \cdot \frac{1}{2}$. We reverse our operations to find the actual predicted # of runs y (not in standard units). $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{y-8}{4}$ and so $y = 10$.

**Answer:** ii) 1

Keep the same definitions as part b). We find $x_{su}=\frac{25-24}{6}=\frac{1}{6}$. Because $x_{su}$ is positive, we know that to achieve the maximum prediction in $y_{su}$, the correlation r must also be positive and its largest possible value. Again, since $-1 \leq r \leq 1$, we know that to satisfy the prior condition, $r = 1$.
