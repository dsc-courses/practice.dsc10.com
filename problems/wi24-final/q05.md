In figure skating, skaters move around an ice rink performing a series
of skills, such as jumps and spins. Ylesia has been training for the
Olympics, and she has a set routine that she plans to perform.

Let's say that Ylesia performs a skill successfully if she does not fall
during that skill. Each skill comes with its own probability of success,
as some skills are harder and some are easier. Suppose that the
probabilities of success for each skill in Ylesia's Olympic routine are
stored in an array called `skill_success`.

For example, if Ylesia's Olympic routine happened to only contain three
skills, `skill_success` might be the array with values 0.92, 0.84, 0.92.
However, her routine can contain any number of skills.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Ylesia wants to simulate one Olympic routine to see how many times she
might fall. Fill in the function `count_falls` below, which takes as
input an array `skill_success` and returns as output the number of times
Ylesia falls during her Olympic routine.
```py

        def count_falls(skill_success):
            falls = 0
            for p in skill_success:
                result = np.random.multinomial(1, __(a)__)
                falls = __(b)__
            return falls
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** (a): `[p, 1-p]`, (b): `falls + result[1]` OR (a): `[1-p, p]`, (b): `falls + result[0]` 

<average>59</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that `prob_no_falls` evaluates to the exact
probability of Ylesia performing her entire routine without falling.

```py
        prob_no_falls = __(a)__
        for p in skill_success:
            prob_no_falls = __(b)__
        prob_no_falls
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>72</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill the blanks below so that `approx_prob_no_falls` evaluates to an
estimate of the probability that Ylesia performs her entire routine
without falling, based on 10,000 trials. Feel free to use the function
you defined in part (a) as part of your solution.

```py
        results = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            results = np.append(results, __(a)__)
        approx_prob_no_falls = __(b)__
        approx_prob_no_falls
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

<average>66</average>

# END SOLUTION
