# BEGIN PROB

Consider the DataFrame
`olympians.drop(columns=["Medal", "Year", "Count"])`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

State a question we could answer using the data in this DataFrame and a
permutation test.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** There are many possible answers for this question. Some examples: "Are male olympians from team USA significantly taller than male olympians from other countries?", "Are olympic swimmers heavier than olympic figure skaters?", "On average, are male athletes heavier than female athletes?"

Recall that a permutation test is basically trying to test if two variables come from the same distribution or if the difference between those two variables are so significant that we can't possibly say that they're from the same distribution. In general, this means the question would have to involve the age, height, or weight column.
Some examples of wrong answers: "

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

State the null and alternative hypotheses for this permutation test.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Also many possible answers depending on your answer for the first question. 

For example, if our question was "Are olympic swimmers heavier than olympic figure skaters?". Then the null hypothesis could be "Olympic swimmers weigh the same as olympic figure skaters" and the alternative could be "olympic swimmers weigh more than figure skaters"

<average>80</average>
