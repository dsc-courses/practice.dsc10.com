# BEGIN PROB

Birgit Fischer-Schmidt is a German canoe paddler who set many records,
including being the only woman to win Olympic medals 24 years apart.

Below is a DataFrame with information about all **12 Olympic medals**
she has won. There are only 10 rows but 12 medals represented, because
there are some years in which she won more than one medal of the same
type.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select one of Birgit's Olympic medals, and see that
it is a gold medal. What is the probability that the medal was earned in
the year 2000? Give your answer as a fully simplified fraction.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{4}$

Reading the prompt we can see that we are solving for a conditional probability. Let A be the given condition that the medal is gold and let B be the event that a medal is from 2000. Looking at the DataFrame we can see that 8 total gold medals are earned (make sure you pay attention to the count column). Out of these 8 medals, 2 of them are from the year 2000. Thus, we obtain the probability $\frac{2}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.

Suppose we randomly select one of Birgit's Olympic medals. What is the
probability it is gold or earned while representing East Germany? Give
your answer as a fully simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{3}{4}$

Here we can recognize that we are solving for the probability of a union of two events. Let A be the event that the medal is gold. Let B be the event that it is earned while representing East Germany. The probability formula for a union is $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$. Looking at the DataFrame, we know $P(A)=\frac{8}{12}$, $P(B)=\frac{4}{12}$, and $P(A \cap B)=\frac{3}{12}$. Plugging all of this into the formula, we get $\frac{8}{12}+\frac{4}{12}-\frac{3}{12}=\frac{9}{12}=\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, the correct answer is $\frac{3}{4}$.

Suppose we randomly select two of Birgit's Olympic medals, without
replacement. What is the probability both were earned in 1988? Give your
answer as a fully simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{1}{22}$

In this problem, we are sampling 2 medals without replacement. Let A be the event that the first medal is from 1988 and let $P(B)$ be the event that the second medal is from 1988. $P(A)$ is $\frac{3}{12}$ since there are 3 medals from 1988 out of the total 12 medals. However, in the second trial, since we are sampling without replacement, the medal that we just sampled is no longer in our pool. Thus, $P(B)$ is now $\frac{2}{11}$ since there are now 2 medals from 1988 from the remaining 11 total medals. The joint probability $P(A \cap B)$ is $P(A)P(B)$ so, plugging these values in, we get $\frac{3}{12} \cdot \frac{2}{12} = \frac{3}{66} = \frac{1}{22}$. Thus, the answer is $\frac{1}{22}$.
