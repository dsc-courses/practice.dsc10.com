# BEGIN PROB

In 2024, the Olympics will include breaking (also known as
breakdancing) for the first time. The breaking competition will include
**16 athletes**, who will compete in a single-elimination tournament.

In the first round, all 16 athletes will compete against an opponent in
a face-to-face "battle\". The 8 winners, as determined by the judges,
will move on to the next round. Elimination continues until the final
round contains just 2 competitors, and the winner of this final battle
wins the tournament.

The table below shows how many competitors participate in each round:

After the 2024 Olympics, suppose we make a DataFrame called `breaking`
containing information about the performance of each athlete during each
round. `breaking` will have one row for each athlete's performance in
each round that they participated. Therefore, there will be $16+8+4+2 =$
**30 rows** in `breaking`.

In the `"name"` column of `breaking`, we will record the athlete's name
(which we'll assume to be unique), and in the other columns we'll record
the judges' scores in the categories on which the athletes will be
judged (creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity, and
musicality).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many rows of `breaking` correspond to the winner of the tournament?
Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 4

Since the winner of the tournament must have won during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and final rounds, there will be a total of four rows in `breaking` corresponding to this winner.

<average>94</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many athletes' names appear exactly twice in the `"name"` column of
`breaking`? Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 4 

For an athlete to appear on exactly two rows in `breaking`, they must get through the 1st round but get eliminated in the 2nd round. There are a total of 8 athletes in the 2nd round, of which 4 are eliminated.

<average>82</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If we merge `breaking` with itself on the `"name"` column,
how many rows will the resulting DataFrame have? Give your answer as an
integer.

*Hint*: Parts (a) and (b) of this question are relevant to part (c).


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 74

This question asks us the number of rows in the DataFrame that results from merging breaking with itself on the `name` column. Let's break this problem down.

Concept:

When a DataFrame is merged with another DataFrame, there will be one row in the output DataFrame for every matching value between the two DataFrames in the row you're merging on. In general, this means you can calculate the number of rows in the output DataFrame the following way:

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{a} in \texttt{df1} } \cdot \text{ Number of instances of \texttt{a} in \texttt{df2}} +
$$

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{b} in \texttt{df1}} \cdot \text{Number of instances of \texttt{b} in \texttt{df2}} +
$$

$$
\vdots
$$

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{n} in \texttt{df1}} \cdot \text{ Number of instances of \texttt{n} in \texttt{df2}}
$$

For example, if there were $2$ instances of `"Jack"` in `df1` and $3$ instances of `"Jack"` in `df2`, there would be $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ instances of `"Jack"` in the output DataFrame.

So, when we're merging a DataFrame with itself, you can calculate the number of rows in the output DataFrame the following way:

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{a} in \texttt{df1} } \cdot \text{ Number of instances of \texttt{a} in \texttt{df1} } +
$$

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{b} in \texttt{df1}} \cdot \text{Number of instances of \texttt{b} in \texttt{df1} } +
$$

$$
\vdots
$$

$$
\text{Number of instances of \texttt{n} in \texttt{df1}} \cdot \text{ Number of instances of \texttt{n} in \texttt{df1} }
$$

which is the same as

$$
\left(\text{Number of instances of \texttt{a} in \texttt{df1} }\right)^2
$$

$$
\left(\text{Number of instances of \texttt{b} in \texttt{df1} }\right)^2
$$

$$
\vdots
$$

$$
\left(\text{Number of instances of \texttt{n} in \texttt{df1} }\right)^2
$$

The Problem:

So, if we can figure out how many instances of each athlete are in breaking, we can calculate the number of rows in the merged DataFrame by squaring these numbers and adding them together.

As it turns out, we can absolutely do this! Consider the following information, drawn from the DataFrame:

1. $8$ athletes are eliminated in the first round, thus only appearing one time in breaking (in the rows corresponding to round one).
2. $4$ athletes are eliminated in the second round, appearing twice in breaking (in the rows corresponding to rounds one and two).
3. $2$ athletes are eliminated in the third round, appearing three times in breaking (in the rows corresponding to rounds one, two, and three).
4. $2$ athletes reach the fourth round, appearing four times in breaking (in the rows corresponding to rounds one, two, three, and four).

Using the formula above for calculating the number of rows in the output DataFrame when merging a DataFrame with itself:

For $8$ athletes, they will appear $1^2 = 1$ time in the merged DataFrame.
For $4$ athletes, they will appear $2^2 = 4$ times in the merged DataFrame.
For $2$ athletes, they will appear $3^2 = 9$ times in the merged DataFrame.
And for the last $2$ athletes, they will appear $4^2 = 16$ times in the merged DataFrame.

So, the total number of rows in the merged DataFrame is

$8(1) + 4(4) + 2(9) + 2(16) = 8 + 16 + 18 + 32 = 74$ rows.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Recall that the number of competitors in each round is $16, 8, 4, 2$.
Write one line of code that evaluates to the array
`np.array([16, 8, 4, 2])`. You **must use** `np.arange` in your
solution, and you **may not use** `np.array` or the DataFrame
`breaking`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `2 ** np.arange(4, 0, -1)`

This problem asks us to write one line of code that evaluates to the array `np.array([16, 8, 4, 2])`.

Concept:

Right away, it should jump out at you that these are powers of $2$ in reverse order. Namely,

`[2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1]`.

The key insight is that exponentiation works element-wise on an array. In otherwords:

`2 ** [4, 3, 2, 1] = [2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1]`.

Given this information, it is simply a matter of constructing a call to `np.arange()` that resuts in the array `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. While there are many calls that achieve this outcome, one example is with the call `np.arange(4, 0, -1)`.

So, the full expression that evaluates to `np.array([16, 8, 4, 2])` is `2 ** np.arange(4, 0, -1)`
