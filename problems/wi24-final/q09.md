In 2024, the Olympics will include breaking (also known as
breakdancing) for the first time. The breaking competition will include
**16 athletes**, who will compete in a single-elimination tournament.

In the first round, all 16 athletes will compete against an opponent in
a face-to-face "battle\". The 8 winners, as determined by the judges,
will move on to the next round. Elimination continues until the final
round contains just 2 competitors, and the winner of this final battle
wins the tournament.

The table below shows how many competitors participate in each round:

After the 2024 Olympics, suppose we make a DataFrame called `breaking`
containing information about the performance of each athlete during each
round. `breaking` will have one row for each athlete's performance in
each round that they participated. Therefore, there will be $16+8+4+2 =$
**30 rows** in `breaking`.

In the `"name"` column of `breaking`, we will record the athlete's name
(which we'll assume to be unique), and in the other columns we'll record
the judges' scores in the categories on which the athletes will be
judged (creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity, and
musicality).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many rows of `breaking` correspond to the winner of the tournament?
Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>94</average>

How many athletes' names appear exactly twice in the `"name"` column of
`breaking`? Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>82</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

$\bigstar$ If we merge `breaking` with itself on the `"name"` column,
how many rows will the resulting DataFrame have? Give your answer as an
integer.

*Hint*: Parts (a) and (b) of this question are relevant to part (c).


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>39</average>

Recall that the number of competitors in each round is $16, 8, 4, 2$.
Write one line of code that evaluates to the array
`np.array([16, 8, 4, 2])`. You **must use** `np.arange` in your
solution, and you **may not use** `np.array` or the DataFrame
`breaking`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>38</average>
