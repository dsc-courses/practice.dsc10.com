In 2024, the Olympics will include breaking (also known as
breakdancing) for the first time. The breaking competition will include
**16 athletes**, who will compete in a single-elimination tournament.

In the first round, all 16 athletes will compete against an opponent in
a face-to-face "battle\". The 8 winners, as determined by the judges,
will move on to the next round. Elimination continues until the final
round contains just 2 competitors, and the winner of this final battle
wins the tournament.

The table below shows how many competitors participate in each round:

After the 2024 Olympics, suppose we make a DataFrame called `breaking`
containing information about the performance of each athlete during each
round. `breaking` will have one row for each athlete's performance in
each round that they participated. Therefore, there will be $16+8+4+2 =$
**30 rows** in `breaking`.

In the `"name"` column of `breaking`, we will record the athlete's name
(which we'll assume to be unique), and in the other columns we'll record
the judges' scores in the categories on which the athletes will be
judged (creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity, and
musicality).

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many rows of `breaking` correspond to the winner of the tournament?
Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 4

Since the winner of the tournament must have won during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and final rounds, there will be a total of four rows in `breaking` corresponding to this winner.

<average>94</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many athletes' names appear exactly twice in the `"name"` column of
`breaking`? Give your answer as an integer.


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 4 

For an athlete to appear on exactly two rows in `breaking`, they must get through the 1st round but get eliminated in the 2nd round. There are a total of 8 athletes in the 2nd round, of which 4 are eliminated.

<average>82</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If we merge `breaking` with itself on the `"name"` column,
how many rows will the resulting DataFrame have? Give your answer as an
integer.

*Hint*: Parts (a) and (b) of this question are relevant to part (c).


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 74

Let's consider 4 separate cases, the athletes who make it into the final round, the athletes who are eliminated in the 3rd round, the athletes who are eliminated in the 2nd round, and the athletes who are eliminated in the 1st round. There are two athletes in the final round, and both of their names appear four times. When merging `breaking` with itself, these two athletes will appear 16 times each in the merged dataframe ($4 \cdot 4$). Two athletes are eliminated in the 3rd round, and their names each appear 3 times in `breaking`. When merging `breaking` with itself, these two athletes will appear 9 times each in the merged dataframe ($3 \cdot 3$). Four athletes are eliminated in the 2nd round, and their names each appear twice in `breaking`. When merging `breaking` with itself, these four athletes will appear 4 times each in the merged dataframe ($2 \cdot 2$). Eight athletes are eliminated in the 1st round, and their names each appear once in `breaking`. When merging `breaking` with itself, these eight athletes will appear 1 time each in the merged dataframe ($1 \cdot 1$). Now, we can add these numbers all up, $16 \cdot 2 + 9 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 4 + 8 \cdot 1 = 74$.


<average>39</average>

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Recall that the number of competitors in each round is $16, 8, 4, 2$.
Write one line of code that evaluates to the array
`np.array([16, 8, 4, 2])`. You **must use** `np.arange` in your
solution, and you **may not use** `np.array` or the DataFrame
`breaking`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `2 ** np.arange(4, 0, -1)`

We notice that $16 = 2^4$, $8 = 2^3$, $4 = 2^2$, and $2 = 2^1$. We can use this pattern and write an expression in the form of `2 ** (something)`. Notice, the exponent terms 4, 3, 2, and 1 are evenly distributed values, and [4, 3, 2, 1] can be generated by np.arange as follows: `np.arange(4, 0, -1)`. 4 is the starting number, 0 is the ending number (exclusive), and -1 is the step size.
