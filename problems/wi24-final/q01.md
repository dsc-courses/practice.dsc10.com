Which of the following columns would be an appropriate index for the
`olympians` DataFrame?

( ) `"Name"`
( ) `"Sport"`
( ) `"Team"`
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: None of these.

To decide what an appropriate index would be, we need to keep in mind that in each row, the index should have a unique value â€“ that is, we want the index to uniquely identify rows of the DataFrame. In this case, there will obviously be repeats in `"team"` and `"sport"`, since these will appear multiple times for each Olympic event. Although the name is unique for each athlete, the same athlete could compete in multiple Olympics (for example, Michael Phelps competed in both 2008 and 2004). So, none of these options is a valid index.
