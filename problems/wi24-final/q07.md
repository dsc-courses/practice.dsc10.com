In our sample, we have data on **1210 medals** for the
sport of gymnastics. Of these, **126** were awarded to American
gymnasts, **119** were awarded to Romanian gymnasts, and the remaining
**965** were awarded to gymnasts from other nations.

We want to do a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses.

**Null**: American and Romanian gymnasts win an equal share of Olympic
gymnastics medals.

**Alternative**: American gymnasts win more Olympic gymnastics medals
than Romanian gymnasts.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which test statistic could we use to test these hypotheses?

( ) total variation distance between the distribution of medals by country and the uniform distribution
( ) proportion of medals won by American gymnasts
( ) difference in the number of medals won by American gymnasts and the number of medals won by Romanian gymnasts
( ) absolute difference in proportion of medals won by American gymnasts and proportion of medals won by Romanian gymnasts

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>73</average>

# END SOLUTION

Below are four different ways of testing these hypotheses. In each case,
fill in the calculation of the observed statistic in the variable
`observed`, such that `p_val` represents the p-value of the hypothesis
test.

Way 1:
```py
        many_stats = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            result = np.random.multinomial(245, [0.5, 0.5]) / 245
            many_stats = np.append(many_stats, result[0] - result[1])
        observed = __(a)__
        p_val = np.count_nonzero(many_stats >= observed)/len(many_stats)
```

Way 2:

```py
        many_stats = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            result = np.random.multinomial(245, [0.5, 0.5]) / 245
            many_stats = np.append(many_stats, result[0] - result[1])
        observed = __(b)__
        p_val = np.count_nonzero(many_stats <= observed)/len(many_stats)
```

Way 3:
```py
        many_stats = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            result = np.random.multinomial(245, [0.5, 0.5]) / 245
            many_stats = np.append(many_stats, result[0])
        observed = __(c)__ 
        p_val = np.count_nonzero(many_stats >= observed)/len(many_stats)
```

Way 4:
```py
        many_stats = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            result = np.random.multinomial(245, [0.5, 0.5]) / 245
            many_stats = np.append(many_stats, result[0])
        observed = __(d)__ 
        p_val = np.count_nonzero(many_stats <= observed)/len(many_stats)
```

The four p-values calculated in Ways 1 through 4 are:

( ) exactly the same
( ) similar, but not necessarily exactly the same
( ) not necessarily similar
