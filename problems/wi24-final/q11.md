Aladár Gerevich is a Hungarian fencer who is one of only
two men to win Olympic medals 28 years apart. He earned 10 Olympic
medals in total throughout his career: 7 gold, 1 silver, and 2 bronze.
The table below shows the distribution of medal types for Aladár
Gerevich, as well as a few other athletes who also earned 10 Olympic
medals.

Which type of data visualization is most appropriate to compare two
athlete's medal distributions?

( ) overlaid histogram
( ) overlaid bar chart
( ) overlaid line plot

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** overlaid bar chart

Here, we are plotting the data of 2 athletes, comparing the medal distributions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are categorical variables, while the proportion of these won is a quantitative value. A bar chart is the only kind of plot that involves categorical data with quantitative data. Since there are 2 athletes, the most appropriate plot is an overlaid bar chart. The overlapping bars would help compare the difference in their distributions.

Among the other athletes in the table above, whose medal distribution
has the largest total variation distance (TVD) to Aladár Gerevich's
distribution?

( ) Katie Ledecky
( ) Alexander Dityatin
( ) Franziska van Almsick

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Franziska van Almsick

The Total Variation Distance (TVD) of two categorical distributions is the sum of the absolute differences of their proportions, all divided by 2. We can apply the TVD formula to these distributions: The TVD between Katie Ledecky and Aladar Gerevich is given by $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (|0.7 - 0.7| + |0.1 - 0.3| + |0.2 - 0|) = \frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$. The TVD between Alexander Dityatin and Aladar Gerevich is given by $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (|0.7 - 0.3| + |0.1 - 0.6| + |0.2 - 0.1|) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. And finally, the TVD between Franziska van Almsick and Aladar Gerevich is given by $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (|0.7 - 0| + |0.1 - 0.4| + |0.2 - 0.6|) = \frac{1.4}{2} = 0.7$. So, Franziska van Almsick has the largest TVD to Gerevich's distribution.

Suppose Pallavi earns 10 Olympic medals in such a way that the TVD
between Pallavi's medal distribution and Aladár Gerevich's medal
distribution is as large as possible. What is Pallavi's medal
distribution?

  **Athlete**        **Gold**   **Silver**   **Bronze**
  ----------------- ---------- ------------ ------------
  Aladár Gerevich      0.7         0.1          0.2
  Pallavi              $x$         $y$          $z$
::: -->

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** x=0, y=1, z=0

Intuitively, can maximize the TVD between the distributions by putting all of Pallavi's medals in the category which Gerevich won the least of, so x = 0, y = 1, z = 0. Moving any of these medals to another category would decrease the TVD, since that would mean that all of Pallavi's medal proportions would get closer to Gerevich's (Silver is decreasing, getting closer, and Gold and Bronze are increasing, which makes them closer as well).


<average>72</average>

More generally, suppose `medal_dist` is an array of length three
representing an athlete's medal distribution. Which of the following
expressions gives the maximum possible TVD between `medal_dist` and any
other distribution?

( ) `medal_dist.max()`
( ) `medal_dist.min()`
( ) `1 - medal_dist.max()`
( ) `1 - medal_dist.min()`
( ) `np.abs(1 - medal_dist).sum()/2`

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `1 - medal_dist.min()`

Similar to part c, we know that the TVD is maximized by placing all the medals of competitor A into the category in which competitor B has the lowest proportion of medals. If we place all of competitor A's medals into this bin, the difference between the two distributions for this variable will be `1 - medal_dist.min()` In the other bins, competitor A has no medals (making all their values 0), and competitor B has the remainder of their medals, which is `1 - medal_dist.min()`. So, in total, the TVD is given by $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot$ `1 - medal_dist.min()` = `1 - medal_dist.min()`.
