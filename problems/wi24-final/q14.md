Suppose that in Olympic ski jumping, ski jumpers jump off of a ramp
that's shaped like a portion of a normal curve. Drawn from left to
right, a full normal curve has an inflection point on the ascent, then a
peak, then another inflection point on the descent. A ski jump ramp
stops at the point that is one third of the way between the inflection
point on the ascent and the peak, measured horizontally. Below is an
example ski jump ramp, along with the normal curve that generated it.

Fill in the blank below so that the expression evaluates to the area of
a ski jump ramp, if the area under the normal curve that generated it is
1.
```py
    from scipy import stats
    stats.norm.cdf(______)
```
What goes in the blank?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `-2/3`

We know that the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, and that the mean is the “peak” described in the graph. The inflection points occur one standard deviation above and below the mean (the peak), so a point which is one third of the way in between the first inflection point and the peak is $-(1-\frac{1}{3}) = -\frac{2}{3}$ standard deviations from the mean. We can then use `stats.norm.cdf(-2/3)` to calculate the area under the curve to the left of this point.

Suppose that in Olympic downhill skiing, skiers compete on mountains
shaped like normal distributions with mean 50 and standard deviation 8.
Skiers start at the peak and ski down the right side of the mountain, so
their $x$-coordinate increases.

Keenan is an Olympic downhill skier, but he's only been able to practice
on a mountain shaped like a normal distribution with mean 65 and
standard deviation 12. In his practice, Keenan always crouches down low
when he reaches the point where his $x$-coordinate is 92, which helps
him ski faster. When he competes at the Olympics, at what $x$-coordinate
should he crouch down low, corresponding to the same relative location
on the mountain?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 68

Since we know that both slopes are normal distributions (just scaled and shifted), we can derive this answer by writing Keenan’s crouch point in terms of standard deviations from the mean. He typically crouches at 92 feet, whose distance from the mean (in standard deviations) is given by $\frac{92 - 65}{12} = 2.25$. So, all we need to do is find what number is 2.25 standard deviations from the mean in the Olympic mountain. This is given by $50 + (2.25 * 8) = 68$

<average>72</average>

Aaron is another Olympic downhill skier. When he competes on the normal
curve mountain with mean 50 and standard deviation 8, he crouches down
low when his $x$-coordinate is $54$. If the total area of the mountain
is 1, approximately how much of the mountain's area is ahead of Aaron at
the moment he crouches down low?

( ) 0.1
( ) 0.2
( ) 0.3
( ) 0.4

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 0.3

We know that when Aaron reaches the mean (50), exactly 0.5 of the mountain’s area is behind him, since the mean and median are equal for normal distributions like this one. We also see that 54 is one half of a standard deviation away from the mean. So, all we have to do is find out what proportion of the area is within half a standard deviation of the mean. Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, we know that 68% of the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean to both the right and left side. So, this means 34% of the values are within one standard deviation on one side and at least 17% are within half a standard deviation on one side. Since the area is 1, the area would be 0.17. So, by the time Aaron reaches an x-coordinate of 54, $0.5 + 0.17 = 0.67$ of the mountain is behind him. From here, we simply calculate the area in front by $1 - 0.67 = 0.33$, so we conclude that approximately 0.3 of the area is in front of Aaron. 

Note: As a clafrification, the 0.17 is an estimate, specifically, an underestimate, due to the shape of the normal distribution. Thse area under a normal distribution is not proportional to how many standard deviations far away from the mean you are.
