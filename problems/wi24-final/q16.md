Suppose `males` is a DataFrame of all male Olympic weightlifting
medalists with a column called `"Weight"` containing their body weight.
Similarly, `females` is a DataFrame of all female Olympic weightlifting
medalists. It also has a `"Weight"` column with body weights.

The `males` DataFrame has **425 rows** and the `females` DataFrame has
**105 rows**, since women's weightlifting became an Olympic sport much
later than men's.

Below, density histograms of the distributions of `"Weight"` in `males`
and `females` are shown on the same axes:

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Estimate the number of males included in the third bin (from $80$ to
$100$). Give your answer as an integer, rounded to the nearest multiple
of $10$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>81</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

Using the `males` DataFrame, write one line of code that evaluates to
the exact number of males included in the third bin (from $80$ to
$100$).


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `males[(males.get("Weight")>=80) & (males.get("Weight")<100)].shape[0]`


<average>75</average>


# END SOLUTION

$\bigstar$ Among Olympic weightlifting medalists who weigh less than
$60$ kilograms, what proportion are male?

( ) less than $0.25$
( ) between $0.25$ and $0.5$
( ) between $0.5$ and $0.75$
( ) more than $0.75$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:**

<average>54</average>
