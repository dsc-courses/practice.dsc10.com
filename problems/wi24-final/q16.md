Suppose `males` is a DataFrame of all male Olympic weightlifting
medalists with a column called `"Weight"` containing their body weight.
Similarly, `females` is a DataFrame of all female Olympic weightlifting
medalists. It also has a `"Weight"` column with body weights.

The `males` DataFrame has **425 rows** and the `females` DataFrame has
**105 rows**, since women's weightlifting became an Olympic sport much
later than men's.

Below, density histograms of the distributions of `"Weight"` in `males`
and `females` are shown on the same axes:

Estimate the number of males included in the third bin (from $80$ to
$100$). Give your answer as an integer, rounded to the nearest multiple
of $10$.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 110

We can estimate the number of males included in the third bin (from 80 to 100) by multiplying the area of that particular histogram bar by the total number of males. The bar has a height of around 0.013 and a width of 20, so the bar has an area of $0.013 \cdot 20 = 0.26$, which means 26% of males fall in that bin. Since there are 425 total males, $0.26 \cdot 425 â‰ˆ 110$ males are in that bin, rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.

Using the `males` DataFrame, write one line of code that evaluates to
the exact number of males included in the third bin (from $80$ to
$100$).


# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `males[(males.get("Weight")>=80) & (males.get("Weight")<100)].shape[0]`

To get the exact number of males in the third bin (from 80 to 100) using code, we can query the males DataFrame to only include rows where `"Weight"` is greater than or equal to 80, and `"Weight"` is less than 100. Remember, a histogram bin includes the lower bound (in this case, 80) and excludes the upper bound (in this case, 100). Remember to put parentheses around each condition, or else the order of operations will change your intended conditions. After querying, we use `.shape[0]` to get the number of rows in that dataframe, therefore getting the number of males with a weight greater than or equal to 80, and less than 100.

Among Olympic weightlifting medalists who weigh less than
$60$ kilograms, what proportion are male?

( ) less than $0.25$
( ) between $0.25$ and $0.5$
( ) between $0.5$ and $0.75$
( ) more than $0.75$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** between $0.5$ and $0.75$

We can answer this question by calculating the approximate number of males and females in the first bin (from 40 to 60). Be careful, we cannot simply compare the areas of the bars because the number of male weightlifting medalists is different from the number of female weightlifting medalists. The approximate number of male weightlifting medalists is equal to $0.008 \cdot 20 \cdot 425 = 68$, while the approximate number of female weightlifting medalists is equal to $0.021 \cdot 20 \cdot 105 = 44$. The proportion of male weightlifting medalists who weigh less than 69 kg is approximately $\frac{68}{68 + 44} = 0.607$, which falls in the category of "between 0.5 and 0.75".
