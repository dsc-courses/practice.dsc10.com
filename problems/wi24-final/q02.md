Frank X. Kugler has Olympic medals in three sports (wrestling,
weightlifting, and tug of war), which is more sports than any other
Olympic medalist. Furthermore, his medals for all three of these sports
are included in the `olympians` DataFrame. Fill in the blanks below so
that the expression below evaluates to `"Frank X. Kugler"`.

```py
                (olympians.groupby(__(a)__).__(b)__
                          .reset_index()
                          .groupby(__(c)__).__(d)__
                          .sort_values(by="Age", ascending=False)
                          .index[0])
```

What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `["Name", "Sport"]` or `["Sport", "Name"]`

The question wants us to find the name (Frank X. Kugler) who has records that correspond to three distinct sports. We know that the same athlete might have multiple records for a distinct sport if they participated in the same sport for multiple years. Therefore we should groupby `"Name"` and `"Sport"` to create a DataFrame with unique Name-Sport pairs. This is a DataFrame that contains the athletes and their sports (for each athlete, their corresponding sports are distinct). If an athlete participated in 2 sports, for example, they would have 2 rows corresponding to them in the DataFrame, 1 row for each distinct sport.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `.sum()` or `.mean()` or `.min()`, etc. 

Any aggregation method applied on `df.groupby()` would work. We only want to remove cases in which an athlete participates in the same sport for multiple years, and get unique name-sport pairs. Therefore, we donâ€™t care about the aggregated numeric value. Notice `.unique()` is not correct because it is not an aggregation method used on dataframe after grouping by. If you use `.unique()`, it will give you "AttributeError: 'DataFrameGroupBy' object has no attribute 'unique'". However, `.unique()` can be used after `Series.groupby()`.

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Name"`

Now after resetting the index, we have `"Name"` and `"Sport"` columns containing unique name-sport pairs. The objective is to count how many different sports each Olympian has medals in. To do that, we groupby `"Name"` and later use the `.count()` method. This would give a new DataFrame that has a count of how many times each name shows up in our previous DataFrame with unique name-sport pairs.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `.count()`

The `.count()` method is applied to each group. In this context, `.count()` will get the number of entries for each Olympian across different sports, since the previous steps ensured each sport per Olympian is uniquely listed (due to the initial groupby on both `"Name"` and `"Sport"`). It does not matter what we sort_values by, because the `.groupby('Name').count()` method will just put a count of each `"Name"` in all of the columns, regardless of the column name or what value was originally in it.
