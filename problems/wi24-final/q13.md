In our sample, we have data on **163 medals** for the sport
of table tennis. Based on our data, China seems to really dominate this
sport, earning **81** of these medals.

That's nearly half of the medals for just one country! We want to do a
hypothesis test with the following hypotheses to see if this pattern is
true in general, or just happens to be true in our sample.

**Null**: China wins half of Olympic table tennis medals.

**Alternative**: China does not win half of Olympic table tennis medals.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Why can these hypotheses be tested by constructing a confidence
interval?

( ) Since proportions are means, so we can use the CLT.
( ) Since the test aims to determine whether a parameter is equal to a fixed value.
( ) Since we need to get a sense of how other samples would come out by bootstrapping.
( ) Since the test aims to determine if our sample came from a known population distribution.

Suppose we construct a 95% bootstrapped CI for the proportion of Olympic
table tennis medals won by China. Select all true statements.

[ ] The true proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China has a 95% chance of falling within the bounds of our interval.
[ ] If we resampled our original sample and calculated the proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China in our resample, there is approximately a 95% chance our interval would contain this number.
[ ] 95% of Olympic table tennis medals are won by China.
[ ] None of the above.

True or False: In this scenario, it would also be appropriate to create
a 95% CLT-based confidence interval.

True or False: If our 95% bootstrapped CI came out to be
$[0.479, 0.518]$, we would reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05
significance level.

( ) True

True or False: If we instead chose to test these hypotheses at the 0.01
significance level, the confidence interval we'd create would be wider.

True or False: If we instead chose to test these hypotheses at the 0.01
significance level, we would be more likely to conclude a statistically
significant result.
