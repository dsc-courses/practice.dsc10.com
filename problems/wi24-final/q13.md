In our sample, we have data on **163 medals** for the sport
of table tennis. Based on our data, China seems to really dominate this
sport, earning **81** of these medals.

That's nearly half of the medals for just one country! We want to do a
hypothesis test with the following hypotheses to see if this pattern is
true in general, or just happens to be true in our sample.

**Null**: China wins half of Olympic table tennis medals.

**Alternative**: China does not win half of Olympic table tennis medals.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Why can these hypotheses be tested by constructing a confidence
interval?

( ) Since proportions are means, so we can use the CLT.
( ) Since the test aims to determine whether a parameter is equal to a fixed value.
( ) Since we need to get a sense of how other samples would come out by bootstrapping.
( ) Since the test aims to determine if our sample came from a known population distribution.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Since the test aims to determine whether a parameter is equal to a fixed value

The goal of a confidence interval is to provide a range of values that, given the data, are considered plausible for the parameter in question. If the null hypothesis' fixed value does not fall within this interval, it suggests that the observed data is not very compatible with the null hypothesis. Thus in our case, if a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of medals won by China does not include ~0.5, then there's statistical evidence at the 5% significance level to suggest that China does not win exactly half of the medals. So again in our case, confidence intervals work to test this hypothesis because we are attempting to find out whether or half of the medals (0.5) lies within our interval at the 95% confidence level.

Suppose we construct a 95% bootstrapped CI for the proportion of Olympic
table tennis medals won by China. Select all true statements.

[ ] The true proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China has a 95% chance of falling within the bounds of our interval.
[ ] If we resampled our original sample and calculated the proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China in our resample, there is approximately a 95% chance our interval would contain this number.
[ ] 95% of Olympic table tennis medals are won by China.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** If we resampled our original sample and calculated the proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China in our resample, there is approximately a 95% chance our interval would contain this number.

The second option is the only correct answer because it accurately describes the process and interpretation of a bootstrap confidence interval. A 95% bootstrapped confidence interval means that if we repeatedly sampled from our original sample and constructed the interval each time, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true parameter. This statement does not imply that the true proportion has a 95% chance of falling within any single interval we construct; instead, it reflects the long-run proportion of such intervals that would contain the true proportion if we could repeat the process indefinitely. Thus, the confidence interval gives us a method to estimate the parameter with a specified level of confidence based on the resampling procedure.

True or False: In this scenario, it would also be appropriate to create
a 95% CLT-based confidence interval.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** True

The statement is true because the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies to the sampling distribution of the proportion, given that the sample size is large enough, which in our case, with 163 medals, it is. The CLT asserts that the distribution of the sample mean (or proportion, in our case) will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size grows, allowing the use of standard methods to create confidence intervals. Therefore, a CLT-based confidence interval is appropriate for estimating the true proportion of Olympic table tennis medals won by China.

True or False: If our 95% bootstrapped CI came out to be
$[0.479, 0.518]$, we would reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05
significance level.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** False

This is false, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis because the interval $[0.479, 0.518]$ includes the value of 0.5, which corresponds to the null hypothesis that China wins half of the Olympic table tennis medals. If the confidence interval contains the hypothesized value, there is not enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level. In this case, the data does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the proportion of medals won by China is different from 0.5 at the 0.05 significance level.

True or False: If we instead chose to test these hypotheses at the 0.01
significance level, the confidence interval we'd create would be wider.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** True

Lowering the significance level means that you require more evidence to reject the null hypothesis, thus seeking a higher confidence in your interval estimate. A higher confidence level corresponds to a wider interval because it must encompass a larger range of values to ensure that it contains the true population parameter with the increased probability. Thus as we lower the significance level, the interval we create will be wider, making this statement true.

True or False: If we instead chose to test these hypotheses at the 0.01
significance level, we would be more likely to conclude a statistically
significant result.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** False

This statement is false. A small significance level lowers the chance of getting a statistically significant result; our value for 0.01 significance has to be outside a 99% confidence interval to be statistically significant. In addition, the true parameter was already contained within the tighter 95% confidence interval, so we failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. This guarantees failing to reject the null hypotehsis at the 0.01 significance level since we know that whatever is contained in a 95% confidence interval has to also be contained in a 99% confidence interval. Thus, this answer is false.
