We want to use the sample of data in `olympians` to
estimate the mean age of Olympic beach volleyball players.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following distributions must be normally distributed in
order to use the Central Limit Theorem to estimate this parameter?

( ) The age distribution of all Olympic athletes.
( ) The age distribution of Olympic beach volleyball players.
( ) The age distribution of Olympic beach volleyball in our sample.
( ) None of the above.

(10 pts) Next we want to use bootstrapping to estimate this parameter.
Which of the following code implementations correctly generates an array
called `sample_means` containing $10,000$ bootstrapped sample means?

Way 1:
```py
    sample_means = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        bv = olympians[olympians.get("Sport") == "Beach Volleyball"]
        one_mean = (bv.sample(bv.shape[0], replace=True)
                      .get("Age").mean())
        sample_means = np.append(sample_means, one_mean)
```

Way 2:
```py
    sample_means = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        bv = olympians[olympians.get("Sport") == "Beach Volleyball"]
        one_mean = (olympians.sample(olympians.shape[0], replace=True)
                             .get("Age").mean())
        sample_means = np.append(sample_means, one_mean)
```
Way 3:
```py
    sample_means = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        resample = olympians.sample(olympians.shape[0], replace=True)
        bv = resample[resample.get("Sport") == "Beach Volleyball"]
        one_mean = bv.get("Age").mean()
        sample_means = np.append(sample_means, one_mean)
```
Way 4:
```py
    sample_means = np.array([])
    bv = olympians[olympians.get("Sport") == "Beach Volleyball"]
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        one_mean = (bv.sample(bv.shape[0], replace=True)
                      .get("Age").mean())
        sample_means = np.append(sample_means, one_mean)
```
Way 5:
```py
    sample_means = np.array([])
    bv = olympians[olympians.get("Sport") == "Beach Volleyball"]
    one_mean = (bv.sample(bv.shape[0], replace=True)
                  .get("Age").mean())
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        sample_means = np.append(sample_means, one_mean)
```

For most of the answer choices in part (b), we do not have enough
information to predict how the standard deviation of `sample_means`
would come out. There is one answer choice, however, where we do have
enough information to compute the standard deviation of `sample_means`.
Which answer choice is this, and what is the standard deviation of
`sample_means` for this answer choice?

There are **68 rows** of `olympians` corresponding to beach volleyball
players. Assume that in part (b), we correctly generated an array called
`sample_means` containing 10,000 bootstrapped sample mean ages based on
this original sample of 68 ages. The standard deviation of the original
sample of 68 ages is approximately how many times larger than the
standard deviation of `sample_means`? Give your answer to the nearest
integer.
