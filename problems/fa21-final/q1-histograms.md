# BEGIN PROB

Let's learn about this problem.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What does the following expression evaluate to?

$$L(x) = f(x) + f(x^2) + f(x^3) + ...$$

Give your answer as a reduced fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

By the law of total probability,

$$lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} L(x) = 174$$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Here's an image. Recreate that DataFrame.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

Here's how you'd do it:

```java

public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("hello, world!");
}
```

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
