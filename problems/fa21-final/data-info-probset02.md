Welcome to the Final Exam! In honor of the (at the time) brand-new Comic-Con Museum that just opened at Balboa Park here in San Diego, this exam will contain questions about various museums and zoos around the world.

In this question, we'll work with the DataFrame `art_museums`, which contains the name, city, number of visitors in 2019, and rank (based on number of visitors) for the 100 most visited art museums in 2019. The first few rows of `art_museums` are shown below.
