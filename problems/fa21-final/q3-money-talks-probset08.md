What is the total variation distance between the distribution of revenue sources in 2003 and the distribution of revenue sources in 2013? Give your answer as a proportion (i.e. a decimal between 0 and 1), **not** a percentage. Round your answer to three decimal places.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.19

Recall, the total variation distance (TVD) is the sum of the absolute differences in proportions, divided by 2. The absolute differences in proportions for each source are as follows:

- Admissions: $|0.15 - 0.24| = 0.09$
- Restaurants and Catering: $|0.09 - 0.12| = 0.03$
- Store: $|0.52 - 0.33| = 0.19$
- Other: $|0.24 - 0.31| = 0.07$

Then, we have

$$\text{TVD} = \frac{1}{2} (0.09 + 0.03 + 0.19 + 0.07) = 0.19$$

<average>95</average>
