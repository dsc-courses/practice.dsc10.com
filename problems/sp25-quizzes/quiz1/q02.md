Steve wants to build a village where each house is built using a
**different** `"Item"` from the `"Materials"` chest (e.g., a cobblestone
house, a wood house, a brick house, etc). Assuming that each house
requires at least 416 blocks of a single material, fill in the blanks so
that the expression below evaluates to the **number of houses** that
Steve's village will have.

```py
    items[(___(a)___) & (___(b)___)].___(c)___
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:**

- **\(a\) `items.get("Chest") == "Materials"`**
- **\(b\) `items.get("Quantity") >= 416`**
- **\(c\) `shape[0]`**

Note that answer (a) and (b) may be swapped. 

(a) <average>71</average>

(b) <average>71</average>

(c) <average>27</average>
