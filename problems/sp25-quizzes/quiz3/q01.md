# BEGIN PROB

The DataFrame `concerts` contains data on a sample of concerts held in
2024. For each concert, we have the name of the performing `"artist"`,
the `"date"` and `"location"` of the concert, and the total
`"attendance"` as an integer. The first few rows of `concerts` are shown
below:

# BEGIN SUBPROB

You are interested in estimating the average `"attendance"` at concerts
using the data in `concerts`. Fill in the blanks to define a function
`estimate_attendance` that takes as input a number of estimates to
produce, and returns an array with that number of bootstrapped estimates
of the mean concert attendance.

    def estimate_attendance(how_many):
        estimates = np.array([])
        for i in __(a)__:
            resample = ___(b)__
            estimates = np.append(estimates, __(c)__.mean())
        return estimates

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `np.arange(how_many)` \
`(b)`: `concerts.sample(concerts.shape[0], replace=True)` \
`(c)`: `resample.get("attendance")` \

<average>82</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Now, fill in the blanks to compute an $85\%$ confidence interval for the
average concert attendance based on $10000$ bootstrapped estimates.

    boot_attendance = estimate_attendance(__(a)__)
    ci_low = np.percentile(boot_attendance, __(b)__)
    ci_high = np.percentile(boot_attendance, __(c)__)
    concert_interval = [ci_low, ci_high]


# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `10000` \
`(b)`: `7.5` \
`(c)`: `92.5` \

<average>90</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose `concert_interval` comes out to $[18500, 19500]$. Which of the
following statements are valid interpretations of this interval? Select
all that apply.

[ ] There is an $85\%$ chance that the average attendance of all concerts is between $18500$ and $19500$.
[ ] $85\%$ of all concerts have an attendance between $18500$ and $19500$.
[ ] If we were to make many different confidence intervals based on different samples of concerts, approximately $85\%$ of the resulting intervals would contain the true average concert attendance.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option 3 only.

<average>84</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

You are told that the data in the `"attendance"` column of `concerts`
has a mean of $19000$ and a standard deviation of $3000$. Find the
endpoints of the smallest interval which is guaranteed to contain at
least $\frac{15}{16}$ of the data. Both endpoints should be given as
**integers**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `[7000, 31000]`

<average>74</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

You are now told that the data in the `"attendance"` column is normally
distributed. Approximately what percentage of the data is included in
the interval you gave above? Give your answer **to the nearest integer**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 100

<average>43</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
