After this year's Sun God Festival, the UCSD administration wants to
estimate how much students would be willing to pay for a ticket to
future Sun God Festivals. They (somehow) take $500$ simple random
samples of $100$ students each, asking them this question. They then
plot a histogram showing the distribution of the mean response from each
sample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

[ ] The histogram will be approximately centered around the mean amount that all UCSD students would be willing to pay.
[ ] The variability in the histogram is due to the fact that we resample with replacement.
[ ] This distribution is an example of an empirical distribution.
[ ] This distribution includes many randomly generated parameters.
[ ] None of the above.
