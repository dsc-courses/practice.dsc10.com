# BEGIN PROB

After this year's Sun God Festival, the UCSD administration wants to
estimate how much students would be willing to pay for a ticket to
future Sun God Festivals. They (somehow) take $500$ simple random
samples of $100$ students each, asking them this question. They then
plot a histogram showing the distribution of the mean response from each
sample.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

[ ] The histogram will be approximately centered around the mean amount that all UCSD students would be willing to pay.
[ ] The variability in the histogram is due to the fact that we resample with replacement.
[ ] This distribution is an example of an empirical distribution.
[ ] This distribution includes many randomly generated parameters.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Options 1 and 3

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB 

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Describe in **one word** how the histogram would be different if it were
instead based on $500$ simple random samples of $1000$ students each.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: narrower

<average>70</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
