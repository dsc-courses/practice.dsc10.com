# BEGIN PROB

Fill in the blanks below to add a new column to `ghibli` called
`"TimeString"`, containing the runtime of each film as a string in hours
and minutes. For example, *Spirited Away* is 125 minutes long, so its
value in the `"TimeString"` column would be `"2 hours, 5 minutes"`.

```py
def change_time(mins):
    hours = ___(a)___
    minutes = ___(b)___
    return str(hours) + " hours, " + str(minutes) + " minutes"
    
ghibli = ghibli.assign(TimeString = ___(c)___)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer (a):** `int(mins / 60)`

<average>73</average>

**Answer (b):** `mins % 60`

<average>62</average>

**Answer (c):** `ghibli.get("Runtime").apply(change_time)`

<average>85</average>
