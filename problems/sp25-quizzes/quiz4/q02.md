According to Indeed, a popular job website, the hourly pay for data
science interns across the US has a mean of $24$ and a standard deviation
of $6$. You take a random sample of $64$ data science interns. In your
sample, the hourly pay has a mean of $25$ and a standard deviation of $4$.
Suppose you bootstrap your sample $10,000$ times, calculate the mean
hourly pay from each resample, and plot a histogram of these resampled
means. Which of the following best describes this histogram?

( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 24 and a standard deviation of $0.75$.
( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of $4$.
( ) Roughly normal with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of $0.5$.
( ) None of the above.
