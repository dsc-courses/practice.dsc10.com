In music theory, **polyphony** is a number that counts how many
independent melodies are being played at the same time. Polyphony is an
integer at any given moment, but the average polyphony for a song can be
a non-integer.

Minchan collects some data on pieces composed by Johann Sebastian Bach
and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Minchan's data is in the DataFrame `music`,
whose first few rows are shown at right. For each piece, we have the
composer and the average polyphony.

Minchan wants to conduct a permutation test with the following
hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The average polyphony of pieces composed by
    Bach and the average polyphony of pieces composed by Mozart are
    drawn from **the same distribution**.

-   **Alt Hypothesis**: The average polyphony of pieces composed by Bach
    and the average polyphony of pieces composed by Mozart are drawn
    from **different distributions**.

For this permutation test, we will use **the absolute difference of
medians** as our test statistic.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below to complete the permtuation test described
above. Assume `observed` is the observed test statistic, and has already
been calculated correctly.

```py
total = 0
for i in np.arange(5000):
    shuffled_composer = np.random.permutation(__(a)__)
    shuffled_df = music.assign(shuff=shuffled_composer)
    poly = shuffled_df.groupby(__(b)__).__(c)__.get("polyphony")
    stat = __(d)__
    if stat __(e)__ observed:
        __(f)__
p_value = total / 5000
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `music.get("composer")` \
`(b)`: `"shuff"` \
`(c)`: `median()` \
`(d)`: `abs(poly.loc["Bach"] - poly.loc["Mozart"])` can be in either order, can also use `iloc[0]`, `iloc[1]` instead \
`(e)`: `>=` \
`(f)`: `total = total + 1`

<average>58</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The following distributions come from the `"polyphony"` column of
`music`:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div>
    <center><strong>Bach's Average Polyphony</strong></center>
    <img src="../../assets/images/sp25-quizzes/bach.png" width="350">
  </div>
  <div>
    <center><strong>Mozart's Average Polyphony</strong></center>
    <img src="../../assets/images/sp25-quizzes/mozart.png" width="350">
  </div>
</div>

<br>

Based on these distributions, estimate the observed value of the test
statistic in the permutation test above. Choose the closest answer
below.

If Minchan repeats the permutation test, this time using **the absolute
difference of means** as the test statistic, how will the observed value
of the test statistic change?

( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **smaller** than before.
( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **the same as** before.
( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **bigger** than before.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option 1
