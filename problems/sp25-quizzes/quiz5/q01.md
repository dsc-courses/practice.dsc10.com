# BEGIN PROB

In music theory, **polyphony** is a number that counts how many
independent melodies are being played at the same time. Polyphony is an
integer at any given moment, but the average polyphony for a song can be
a non-integer.

Minchan collects some data on pieces composed by Johann Sebastian Bach
and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Minchan's data is in the DataFrame `music`,
whose first few rows are shown at right. For each piece, we have the
composer and the average polyphony.

Minchan wants to conduct a permutation test with the following
hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The average polyphony of pieces composed by
    Bach and the average polyphony of pieces composed by Mozart are
    drawn from **the same distribution**.

-   **Alt Hypothesis**: The average polyphony of pieces composed by Bach
    and the average polyphony of pieces composed by Mozart are drawn
    from **different distributions**.

For this permutation test, we will use **the absolute difference of
medians** as our test statistic.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below to complete the permtuation test described
above. Assume `observed` is the observed test statistic, and has already
been calculated correctly.

```py
total = 0
for i in np.arange(5000):
    shuffled_composer = np.random.permutation(__(a)__)
    shuffled_df = music.assign(shuff=shuffled_composer)
    poly = shuffled_df.groupby(__(b)__).__(c)__.get("polyphony")
    stat = __(d)__
    if stat __(e)__ observed:
        __(f)__
p_value = total / 5000
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

`(a)`: `music.get("composer")` \
`(b)`: `"shuff"` \
`(c)`: `median()` \
`(d)`: `abs(poly.loc["Bach"] - poly.loc["Mozart"])` can be in either order, can also use `iloc[0]`, `iloc[1]` instead \
`(e)`: `>=` \
`(f)`: `total = total + 1`

<average>58</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The following distributions come from the `"polyphony"` column of
`music`:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div>
    <center><strong>Bach's Average Polyphony</strong></center>
    <img src="../../assets/images/sp25-quizzes/bach.png" width="350">
  </div>
  <div>
    <center><strong>Mozart's Average Polyphony</strong></center>
    <img src="../../assets/images/sp25-quizzes/mozart.png" width="350">
  </div>
</div>

<br>

Based on these distributions, estimate the observed value of the test
statistic in the permutation test above. Choose the closest answer
below.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $−3$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $−2$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $−1$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $0$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $1$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $2$</label>
  <label style="margin: 10px 25px;"><input type="radio" name="q1"> $3$</label>
</div>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $1$

<average>51</average>

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If Minchan repeats the permutation test, this time using **the absolute
difference of means** as the test statistic, how will the observed value
of the test statistic change?

( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **smaller** than before.
( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **the same as** before.
( ) The observed value of the test statistic will be **bigger** than before.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option 1

<average>48</average>
