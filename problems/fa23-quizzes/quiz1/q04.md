Suppose `students` is a DataFrame of all students who took DSC 10 last
quarter. `students` has one row per student, where:

-   The index contains students' PIDs as strings starting with `"A"`.

-   The `"Overall"` column contains students' overall percentage grades
    as floats.

-   The `"Animal"` column contains students' favorite animals as
    strings.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type is `students.get("Overall")`? If this expression errors,
select "this errors.\"

( ) float
( ) string
( ) array
( ) Series
( ) this errors

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Series

What type is `students.get("PID")`? If this expression errors, select
"this errors.\"

( ) float

Vanessa is one student who took DSC 10 last quarter. Her PID is
A12345678, she earned the sixth-highest overall percentage grade in the
class, and her favorite animal is the giraffe.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Supposing that `students` is already sorted by `"Overall"` in
**descending** order, fill in the blanks so that `animal_one` and
`animal_two` **both** evaluate to `"giraffe"`.

```py
animal_one = students.get(__(x)__).loc[__(y)__]
animal_two = students.get(__(x)__).iloc[__(z)__]
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- `x`: `"Animal"`
- `y`: `"A12345678"`
- `z`: `5`

<average>69</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

If `students` wasn't already sorted by `"Overall"` in descending order,
which of your answers would need to change?

( ) Neither `y` nor `z` would need to change   
( ) Both `y` and `z` would need to change
( ) `y` only
( ) `z` only

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `z` only

<average>82</average>
