You survey 100 DSC majors and 140 CSE majors to ask them which video
streaming service they use most. The resulting distributions are given
in the table below. Note that each column sums to 1.

::: center
  **Service**           **DSC Majors**   **CSE Majors**
  -------------------- ---------------- ----------------
  Netflix                    0.4              0.35
  Hulu                       0.25             0.2
  Disney+                    0.1              0.1
  Amazon Prime Video         0.15             0.3
  Other                      0.1              0.05

For example, 20% of CSE Majors said that Hulu is their most used video
streaming service. Note that if a student doesn't use video streaming
services, their response is counted as Other.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the total variation distance (TVD) between the distribution for
DSC majors and the distribution for CSE majors? Give your answer as an
exact decimal.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.15

<average>89</average>
# END SOLUTION

Suppose we only break down video streaming services into four
categories: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Other (which now includes Amazon
Prime Video). Now we recalculate the TVD between the two distributions.
How does the TVD now compare to your answer to part (a)?

( ) less than (a) 
( ) equal to (a) 
( ) greater than (a)

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: less than (a)

<average>93</average>
