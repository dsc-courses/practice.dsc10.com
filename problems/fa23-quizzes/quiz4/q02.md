# BEGIN PROB

You want to estimate the proportion of DSC majors who have a Netflix
subscription. To do so, you will survey a random sample of DSC majors
and ask them whether they have a Netflix subscription. You will then
create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of "yes\" answers in
the population, based on the responses in your sample. You decide that
your confidence interval should have a width of at most 0.10.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In order for your confidence interval to have a width of at most 0.10,
the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample proportion must
be at most $T$. What is $T$? Give your answer as an exact decimal.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.025

<average>46</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Using the fact that the standard deviation of any dataset of 0s and 1s
is no more than 0.5, calculate the minimum number of people you would
need to survey so that the width of your confidence interval is at most
0.10. Give your answer as an integer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 400

<average>81</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
