Arya was curious how many UCSD students used Hulu over Thanksgiving
break. He surveys 250 students and finds that 130 of them did use Hulu
over break and 120 did not.

Using this data, Arya decides to test following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: Over Thanksgiving break, an equal number of
    UCSD students did use Hulu and did not use Hulu.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: Over Thanksgiving break, **more** UCSD
    students did use Hulu than did not use Hulu.

Which of the following could be used as a test statistic for the
hypothesis test?

( ) The proportion of students who did use Hulu minus the proportion of students who did not use Hulu.
( ) The absolute value of the proportion of students who did use Hulu minus the proportion of students who did not use Hulu.
( ) The proportion of students who did use Hulu plus the proportion of students who did not use Hulu.
( ) The absolute value of the proportion of students who did use Hulu plus the proportion of students who did not use Hulu.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: The proportion of students who did use Hulu minus the proportion of
students who did not use Hulu.

<average>81</average>

If the p-value of the hypothesis test is 0.053, what can we conclude, at
the standard 0.05 significance level?

( ) We reject the null hypothesis.
( ) We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
( ) We accept the null hypothesis.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
