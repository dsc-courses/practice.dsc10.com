The DataFrame `items` describes various items available to collect or purchase using bells, the currency used in the game _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_.

For each item, we have:

- `"Item" (str)`: The name of the item.
- `"Cost" (int)`: The cost of the item in bells. Items that cost 0 bells cannot be purchased and must be collected through other means (such as crafting).
- `"Location" (str)`: The store or action through which the item can be obtained.


The first 6 rows of `items` are below, though `items` has more rows than are shown here.
