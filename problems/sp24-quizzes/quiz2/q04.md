Fill in the return statement of the function `is_expensive`, which takes
as input the price of an art piece (as a float, in dollars) and returns
`True` if the price is more than 20 million dollars. Otherwise, it
returns `False`.

```py
def is_expensive(price):
        return ___(a)___
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `price > 20_000_000`

<average>74</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Write one line of code to add a new column called `exp` to the `art` DataFrame, which categorizes if each art piece is worth more than 20 million dollars, using Boolean values. You must use the `is_expensive` function you wrote above. Make sure to modify `art`!

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `art = art.assign(exp = art.get("price").apply(is_expensive))`

<average>73</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Next, we make a new DataFrame called `expensive` as follows.

```py
expensive = art[art.get(exp)]
merged = art.merge(expensive, on="artist")
```

Van Gogh is one artist represented in `art` and exactly half of his
pieces in `art` are worth over 20 million dollars. If Van Gogh's art
appears in 72 rows of the `merged` DataFrame, how many rows does Van
Gogh actually have in the original `art` DataFrame?


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 12

<average>16</average>
