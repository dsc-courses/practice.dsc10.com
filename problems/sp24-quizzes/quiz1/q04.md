Suppose `flower_data` is a DataFrame with information on different
species of flowers, where:

-   The `"species"` column contains the name of the species of flower,
    as a string. Each value in this column is unique.

-   The `"petals"` column contains the average number of petals of
    flowers of this species, as an `int`.

-   The `"length"` column contains the average stem length of flowers of
    this species in inches, as a `float`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

One of these three columns is a good choice to use as the index of this
DataFrame. Write a line of code that sets this column as the index of
`flower_data`, and assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable
`flowers`.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `flowers = flower_data.set_index("species")`

<average>79</average>


# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

**Important:** The following questions will use `flowers` instead of
`flower_data`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following expressions evaluates to a DataFrame that is
sorted by `"petals"` in descending order?

( ) `flowers.sort_values(by = "petals", ascending = True)`
( ) `flowers.sort_values(by = "petals", ascending = False)`
( ) `flowers.get("petals").sort_values(ascending = True)`
( ) `flowers.get("petals").sort_values(ascending = False)`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option B

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that the 4th row of `flowers` corresponds to a rare species of
flower named `"fire lily"`. Fill in the blanks below so that both of
these expressions evaluate to the stem length in inches of
`"fire lily"`.

    i. flowers.get("length").loc[__(x)__]
    ii. flowers.get("length").iloc[__(y)__]

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: (x): `"fire lily"`, (y): `3`

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that the 3rd row of `flowers` corresponds to the species
`"stinking corpse lily"`. Using the `flowers` DataFrame and the string
method `.split()`, write an expression that evaluates to `"corpse"`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**: `flowers.index[2].split(" ")[1]`

<average>46</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
