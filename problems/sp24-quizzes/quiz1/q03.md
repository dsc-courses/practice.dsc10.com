You are tracking the growth of a flower stem over a seven-day period.
The flower stem starts out at 24.5 cm and ends up at 29.7 cm.

Write one line of code that calculates the average daily growth, in
centimeters, and assigns the result to the variable `avg_growth`. Do not
round your answer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `avg_growth = (29.7 - 24.5) / 7`

<average>84</average>
