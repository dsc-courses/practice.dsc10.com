The DataFrame `restaurants` contains information about a sample of
restaurants in San Diego County. We have each restaurant's
`"name" (str)`, `"rating" (int)`, average `"meal_price" (float)`, and
type of `"cuisine" (str)`, such as `"Thai"` or `"Italian"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

You are interested in estimating the average `"meal_price"` across all
Italian restaurants in San Diego County using only the data in
`restaurants`. Fill in the following code so that `italian_means`
evaluates to an array of 1000 bootstrapped estimates for this parameter.

```py
    def bootstrap_means(data, n_samples):
        means = np.array([])
        for i in range(n_samples):
            resample = data.sample(__(a)__, replace = __(b)__)
            means = np.append(means, __(c)__)
        return means

    italian_restaurants = __(d)__
    italian_means = bootstrap_means(italian_restaurants, __(e)__)
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a): `data.shape[0]` \
(b): `True` \
(c): `resample.get("meal price").mean()` \
(d): `restaurants[restaurants.get("cuisine") == "Italian"]` \
(e): `1000`

<average>73</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Next, fill in the blanks below so that `italian_CI` evaluates to an 88%
bootstrapped confidence interval for the average `"meal_price"` across
all Italian restaurants in San Diego County.

```py
    lower_bound = np.percentile(italian_means, __(a)__)
    upper_bound = np.percentile(italian_means, __(b)__)
    italian_CI = [lower_bound, upper_bound]

```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

(a): `6` \
(b): `94`

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose `italian_CI` evaluates to \[25, 35\]. Which of the following
statements are correct? Select all that apply.

[ ] If we randomly selected 1000 Italian restaurants from the population of Italian restaurants in San Diego County, about 880 of them will have an average `"meal_price"` &nbsp;between $25 and $35.
[ ] There is an 88% chance that the average `"meal_price"` of Italian restaurants in San Diego County falls between \$25 and \$35.
[ ] 88% of all Italian restaurants have an average `"meal_price"` between $25 and $35.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

Option 4: None of the above.

<average>64</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
