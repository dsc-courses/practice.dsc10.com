Suppose that the trees on UCSD's campus have a mean height of 100 feet
and a **variance** of 36 feet. If the height of a specific tree is 124
feet, what would its height be in standard units for this distribution?

Let $A$ be the answer to the previous question. Choose the best interpretation of $A$.

( ) A randomly selected tree on UCSD's campus has an $A$ percent probability of being at least 124 feet tall.
( ) A 124 foot tree is $A$ times taller than the average tree on UCSD's campus.
( ) A 124 foot tree is $A$ standard deviations taller than the average tree on UCSD's campus.
( ) At least 95% of trees on UCSD's campus have a height within $A$ standard deviations of the mean height.

**Answer**: A 124 foot tree is $A$ standard deviations taller than the average
tree on UCSD's campus.
