# BEGIN PROB

We want to collect a sample of trees and use this sample to determine
the proportion of all trees that are oak trees (a population parameter).
We want to create a 95% confidence interval that is at most 0.04 wide.
Which of the following inequalities should we use to find the smallest
viable sample size we could collect?

( ) $\text{sample size} \geq (4 * \frac{0.5}{0.04})^2$
( ) $\text{sample size} \geq (2 * \frac{0.5}{0.04})^2$
( ) $\text{sample size} \geq (4 * \frac{1}{0.04})^2$
( ) $\text{sample size} \geq (2 * \frac{1}{0.04})$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\text{sample size} \geq (4 * \frac{0.5}{0.04})^2$

<average>52</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
