Suppose we measure the height in feet of a sample of trees on UCSD's
campus and use this sample to generate a 95% CLT-based confidence
interval for the mean height of trees on campus. Let $W$ be the width of
this confidence interval.

If we instead were to measure the height of the same sample in inches,
and again generate a 95% CLT-based confidence interval for the mean,
what would be the width of this confidence interval in terms of $W$?
There are 12 inches in 1 foot.

( ) $\dfrac{W}{12}$ 
( ) $\dfrac{W}{\sqrt{12}}$ 
( ) $W$ 
( ) $12W$ 
( ) $144W$

**Answer**: $12W$
