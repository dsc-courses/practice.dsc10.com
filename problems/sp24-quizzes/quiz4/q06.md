# BEGIN PROB

Suppose that the trees on UCSD's campus are 35% eucalyptus, 25% pine,
and the remaining 40% some other variety. Write **one line of code** to
simulate the act of randomly sampling 40 trees from this distribution,
with replacement. Your code should output an array of length 3 where the
elements represent the number of eucalyptus, pine, and other trees,
respectively.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `np.random.multinomial(40, [0.35, 0.25, 0.40])`

<average>85</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
