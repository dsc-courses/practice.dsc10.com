You want to determine if the bikes for sale locally have the following
distribution of `"style"`: `"electric"` (15%), `"mountain"` (20%),
`"road"` (40%), `"hybrid"` (20%), and `"recumbent"` (5%). You want to
use the 500 rows of `bikes` to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null**: Bikes for sale locally are randomly drawn from the
    proposed distribution.

-   **Alt**: Bikes for sale locally are not randomly drawn from the
    proposed distribution.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose that in `bikes`, the `"style"` column is distributed as follows:
`"electric"` (20%), `"mountain"` (20%), `"road"` (30%), `"hybrid"`
(20%), and `"recumbent"` (10%).

Let's do a hypothesis test with total variation distance (TVD) as the
test statistic. Fill in the blanks below to complete a simulation that
calculates 10,000 TVDs under the null hypothesis.

    def total_variation_distance(distr1, distr2):
        return __(a)__

    proposed = np.array([0.15, 0.20, 0.40, 0.20, 0.05])
    observed = np.array([0.20, 0.20, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10])
    tvds = np.array([])
    for i in np.arange(10000):
        simulated = np.random.multinomial(__(b)__, __(c)__) / 500
        new_tvd = total_variation_distance(__(d)__, __(e)__)
        tvds = np.append(tvds, new_tvd)

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**:\
(a): `np.abs((distr1 - distr2)).sum() / 2`\
(b): `500`\
(c): `proposed`\
(d): `simulated`\
(e): `proposed`

<average>78</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that `observed_tvd` corresponds to the
observed value of the test statistic for this hypothesis test.

    observed_tvd = total_variation_distance(__(f)__, __(g)__)

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer**:\
(f): `observed`\
(g): `proposed`

<average>83</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following correctly calculates the p-value for this
hypothesis test?

( ) `p_value = np.count_nonzero(tvds >= observed_tvd) / len(observed)`
( ) `p_value = np.count_nonzero(tvds >= observed_tvd) / len(tvds)`
( ) `p_value = np.count_nonzero(tvds <= observed_tvd) / len(observed)`
( ) `p_value = np.count_nonzero(tvds <= observed_tvd) / len(tvds)`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `p_value = np.count_nonzero(tvds >= observed_tvd) / len(tvds)`

<average>73</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
