# BEGIN PROB

Recall from the last problem that the DataFrame `trick_or_treat` includes a column called `"price"` with the cost in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy, as a `float`.

Assume we have run the line of code `tot = trick_or_treat` to reassign
`trick_or_treat` to the shorter variable name `tot`.

In this problem, we'll use `tot` to calculate the total amount of money
that each house spent on Halloween candy. This number is always less
than $\$80$ for the houses in our data set.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that the following block of code plots a
histogram that displays the distribution of the total amount of money
that houses spent on Halloween candy, in dollars.

    total = (tot.assign(total_spent = ___(a)___)
                .groupby(___(b)___).___(c)___)
    total.plot(kind = "hist",  y = "total_spent", density = True,
               bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10))
                
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

- (a): `tot.get("price") * tot.get("how_many")`

- (b): "address"

- (c): `sum()`

**(a): `tot.get("price") * tot.get("how_many")`**

   - `tot.get("price")` retrieves the cost of a single piece of candy.
   - `tot.get("how_many")` retrieves the number of pieces of candy given out.
   - Multiplying these two columns calculates the total amount spent on candy for each row in the dataset.
   - This step creates a new column `total_spent` that represents the total money spent for each type of candy at a given house.


**(b): "address"**

   - The data is grouped by the `"address"` column, which uniquely identifies each house. This ensures that all records associated with a single house are aggregated together.

**(c): `sum()`**

   - After grouping by `"address"`, the `.sum()` operation aggregates the total amount of money spent on candy for each house. This sums up all `total_spent` values for records belonging to the same house.

Final Output: The `total` DataFrame will have one row for each house, with the column `total_spent` representing the total money spent on Halloween candy. Finally, the `total.plot` command creates a histogram of the `total_spent` values to visualize the distribution of spending across houses.

The histogram below displays the distribution of the total amount of
money that houses spent on Halloween candy; it is the histogram that
would be generated from the code snippet above, assuming the blanks were
filled in correctly.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which two adjacent bins in the histogram represent about $50\%$ of the
houses?

( ) `[10, 20)` and `[20, 30)`
( ) `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)`
( ) `[30, 40)` and `[40, 50)`
( ) `[40, 50)` and `[50, 60)`
( ) `[50, 60)` and `[60, 70)`
( ) Not possible to determine.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)`

- The histogram shows that the bins `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)` have the two tallest bars, with heights of 0.020 and 0.030, respectively.
- Each bar's height represents the density of data in that range (proportion of houses divided by bin width). Since the bin width is 10, we can multiply the height by 10 to calculate the proportion of data in each bin:
  - `[20, 30)` contributes $0.020 \times 10 = 0.2$ or $20\%$ of the houses.
  - `[30, 40)` contributes $0.030 \times 10 = 0.3$ or $30\%$ of the houses.
- Together, these two bins account for $20\% + 30\% = 50\%$ of the houses.

Suppose we create a new histogram, using the same code as above but with
`bins = np.arange(0, 90, 20)` instead of `bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10)`.
Approximate the height of the tallest bar in this new histogram. If this is not possible, write "Not possible to determine.\"

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.025

- With the new bin width of 20, the histogram combines adjacent bins from the original histogram. The new bins become `[0, 20)`,`[20, 40)`,`[40, 60)`,`[60, 80)`. The bin `[20, 40)` merges the original bins `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)` and would be the bin with the highest bar in the new histogram.
- To find the total proportion of data in `[20, 40)`:
  - From the original histogram:
    - `[20, 30)` contributes $0.020 \times 10 = 0.2$ (20%).
    - `[30, 40)` contributes $0.030 \times 10 = 0.3$ (30%).
  - Total for `[20, 40)` is $0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5$ or $50\%$.
- The new bin width is 20, so the height of the bar is calculated as:
Height = $\frac{\text{Proportion}}{\text{Bin Width}}$ = $\frac{0.5}{20}$ = 0.025\
- Therefore, the tallest bar in the new histogram has a height of 0.025.

Suppose we create a new histogram, using the same code as above but
substituting `bins = np.arange(0, 90, 5)` for
`bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10)`. Approximate the height
of the tallest bar in this new histogram. If this is not possible, write "Not possible to determine.\"

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Not possible to determine.

- In the original histogram, the bins are 10 units wide (e.g., `[20, 30)`). When switching to 5-unit bins (e.g., `[20, 25)`, `[25, 30)`), we need to know the distribution of data within the original 10-unit bins to calculate the new bar heights.
- The histogram does not provide this detailed information. For example, we cannot determine whether the data in `[20, 30)` is evenly distributed between `[20, 25)` and `[25, 30)` or concentrated in one of the sub-bins.
- Without this additional information, it is impossible to approximate the height of the tallest bar accurately.
