# BEGIN PROB

Recall from the last problem that the DataFrame `trick_or_treat` includes a column called `"price"` with the cost in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy, as a `float`.

Assume we have run the line of code `tot = trick_or_treat` to reassign
`trick_or_treat` to the shorter variable name `tot`.

In this problem, we'll use `tot` to calculate the total amount of money
that each house spent on Halloween candy. This number is always less
than $\$80$ for the houses in our data set.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks below so that the following block of code plots a
histogram that displays the distribution of the total amount of money
that houses spent on Halloween candy, in dollars.

    total = (tot.assign(total_spent = ___(a)___)
                .groupby(___(b)___).___(c)___)
    total.plot(kind = "hist",  y = "total_spent", density = True,
               bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10))
                
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 

- (a): `tot.get("price") * tot.get("how_many")`

- (b): "address"

- (c): `sum()`

<average>65</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

The histogram below displays the distribution of the total amount of
money that houses spent on Halloween candy; it is the histogram that
would be generated from the code snippet above, assuming the blanks were
filled in correctly.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which two adjacent bins in the histogram represent about $50\%$ of the
houses?

( ) `[10, 20)` and `[20, 30)`
( ) `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)`
( ) `[30, 40)` and `[40, 50)`
( ) `[40, 50)` and `[50, 60)`
( ) `[50, 60)` and `[60, 70)`
( ) Not possible to determine.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `[20, 30)` and `[30, 40)`

<average>83</average>

Suppose we create a new histogram, using the same code as above but with
`bins = np.arange(0, 90, 20)` instead of `bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10)`.
Approximate the height of the tallest bar in this new histogram. If this is not possible, write "Not possible to determine.\"

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 0.025

<average>38</average>

Suppose we create a new histogram, using the same code as above but
substituting `bins = np.arange(0, 90, 5)` for
`bins = np.arange(0, 90, 10)`. Approximate the height
of the tallest bar in this new histogram. If this is not possible, write "Not possible to determine.\"

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Not possible to determine.
