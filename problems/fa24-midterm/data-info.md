Trick-or-treating is a Halloween tradition, where children wear costumes and walk around their neighborhood from house to house to collect candy. In this exam, you'll work with a data set representing the candy given out on Halloween. Each row represents one type of candy given out by one house in San Diego.

The columns of `treat` are as follows:

-   `"address"` (`str`): The address of the house giving out candy.
-   `"candy"` (`str`): The type of candy that is being given out. 
-   `"how_many"` (`int`): How many pieces of candy are being given out.
-   `"neighborhood"` (`str`): The neighborhood that the house is in.

The first few rows of `treat` are shown below, though `treat` has many more rows than pictured.

Throughout this exam, we will refer to `treat` repeatedly. Assume that we have already run `import babypandas as bpd` and `import numpy as np`.
