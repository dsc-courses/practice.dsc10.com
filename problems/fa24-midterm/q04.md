# BEGIN PROB

The `"address"` column contains quite a bit of information. All houses
are in `"San Diego, CA"`, but the street address and the zip code vary.
Note that the "street address\" includes both the house number and
street name, such as `"820 Opal Street"`. All addresses are formatted in
the same way, for example, `"820 Opal Street, San Diego, CA, 92109"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks in the function `address_part` below. The function
has two inputs: a value in the index of `treat` and a string `part`,
which is either `"street"` or `"zip"`. The function should return the
appropriate part of the address at the given index value, as a string.
Example behavior is given below.

    >>> address_part(4, "street")
    "8575 Jade Coast Drive"

    >>> address_part(1, "zip")
    "92109"

The function already has a return statement included. You should not add
the word `return` anywhere else!

    def address_part(index_value, part):
        if part == "street":
            var = 0
        else:
            ___(a)___
        return treat.get("address").loc[___(b)___].___(c)___


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**:

- (a): `var = 3`, `var = -1` or alternate solution `var = 1`

- (b): `index_value`

- (c): `split(", ")[var]` or alternate solution `split(", San Diego, CA, ")[var]`

<average>58</average>

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we had a different function called `zip_as_int` that took as
input a single address, formatted exactly as the addresses in `treat`,
and returned the zip code as an `int`. Write a Python expression using
the `zip_as_int` function that evaluates to a Series with the zip codes
of all the addresses in `treat`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `treat.get("address").apply(zip_as_int)`
