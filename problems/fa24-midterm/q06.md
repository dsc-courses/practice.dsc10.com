# BEGIN PROB

Suppose you visit a house that has 40 Twix, 50 M&Ms, and 10 KitKats in a
bowl. You take three pieces of candy from this bowl.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability you get all Twix?

( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{100} \cdot \dfrac{38}{100}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{99} \cdot \dfrac{40}{98}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{100}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{99} \cdot \dfrac{38}{98}$


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{99} \cdot \dfrac{38}{98}$

<average>94</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability you get no Twix? Leave your answer **completely unsimplified**, similar to the answer choices for part (a).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\dfrac{60}{100} \cdot \dfrac{59}{99} \cdot \dfrac{58}{98}$

<average>81</average>

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Let $a$ be your answer to part (a) and let $b$ be your answer to part
(b). Write a mathematical expression in terms of $a$ and/or $b$ that
evaluates to the probability of getting some Twix and some non-Twix
candy from this house.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $1 - a - b$ or $1 - (a + b)$

<average>30</average>
