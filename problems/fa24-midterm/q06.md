Suppose you visit a house that has 40 Twix, 50 M&Ms, and 10 KitKats in a
bowl. You take three pieces of candy from this bowl.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability you get all Twix?

( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{100} \cdot \dfrac{38}{100}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{99} \cdot \dfrac{40}{98}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{40}{100}$
( ) $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{99} \cdot \dfrac{38}{98}$


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\dfrac{40}{100} \cdot \dfrac{39}{99} \cdot \dfrac{38}{98}$

We need to find the probability that we get all Twix among the three candies selected from the bowl. Since we are selecting three times from the same bowl, we know that we are selecting **without replacement**. 

1. **First Selection:**  
   - There are 40 Twix and 40 + 50 + 10 = 100 candies in the bowl, meaning the
   probability of selecting a Twix is $\frac{40}{100}$.


2. **Second Selection:**  
   - Now that we have chosen one Twix there are 39 Twix and 99 candies left, meaning that the probability of selecting a Twix now is $\frac{39}{99}$.
   

3. **Third Selection:**  
   - After selecting two Twix there are 38 Twix and 98 candies left, meaning the probability of selecting a Twix is $\frac{38}{98}$.

The total probability that we grab all Twix from the bowl is the product of these probabilities: **$\frac{40}{100} \cdot \frac{39}{99} \cdot \frac{38}{98}$**

What is the probability you get no Twix? Leave your answer **completely unsimplified**, similar to the answer choices for part (a).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\dfrac{60}{100} \cdot \dfrac{59}{99} \cdot \dfrac{58}{98}$

We need to find the probability that we get no Twix among the three candies selected from the bowl. We know that two candies are not Twix in our bowl (M&Ms and Kitkats). Since we are selecting three times from the same bowl, we know that we are selecting **without replacement**.  

1. **First Selection:**  
   - There are 60 non-Twix candies in the bowl (50 M&Ms and 10 Kitkats) and 100 total candies. This means the probability of selecting a non-Twix is $\frac{60}{100}$.


2. **Second Selection:**  
   - Regardless of which non-Twix candy was chosen, there are now 59 non-Twix candies in the bowl (49 M&Ms and 10 Kitkats OR 50 M&Ms and 9 Kitkats). Since there are 99 total candies in the bowl, the probability of selecting a non-Twix is $\frac{59}{99}$.
   

3. **Third Selection:**  
   - After selecting two non-Twix there are 58 non-Twix and 98 total candies left meaning the probability of selecting a non-Twix is $\frac{58}{98}$.

The total probability that we grab no Twix from the bowl is the product of these probabilities: **$\frac{60}{100} \cdot \frac{59}{99} \cdot \frac{58}{98}$**

Let $a$ be your answer to part (a) and let $b$ be your answer to part
(b). Write a mathematical expression in terms of $a$ and/or $b$ that
evaluates to the probability of getting some Twix and some non-Twix
candy from this house.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $1 - a - b$ or $1 - (a + b)$

The case where we get some Twix and some non-Twix occurs can also be thought of as the case when we **DO NOT** get either all Twix **OR** all non-Twix. In 6.1 we calculated the probability of getting all Twix as $a$ and in 6.2 we calculated the probability of getting all non-Twix as $b$. Therefore the probability of getting either all Twix **OR** all non-Twix is equal to $a + b$. However, we are looking for the probability that this **does not** happen, meaning our answer is $1 - (a + b)$.
