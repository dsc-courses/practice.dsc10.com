As in the last problem, we'll continue working with the `tot` DataFrame
that came from merging `trick` with `treat`. The `"price"` column
contains the cost in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy,
as a `float`.

In this problem, we want to use `tot` to calculate the **average cost
per piece** of Halloween candy at each house. For example, suppose one
house has 30 Twix, which cost $\$0.20$ each, and 20 Laffy Taffy, which
cost $\$0.10$ each. Then this house spent $\$8.00$ on 50 pieces of
candy, for an average cost of $\$0.16$ per piece.

Which of the following correctly sets `ac` to a DataFrame indexed by
`"address"` with a column called `"avg_cost"` that contains the average
cost per piece of Halloween candy at each address? Select all that
apply.

Way 1:

    ac = tot.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("price") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 2:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("price") / tot.get("how_many"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x").mean()).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 3:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("price") / tot.get("how_many"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 4:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("how_many") * tot.get("price"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x").mean()).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 5:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("how_many") * tot.get("price"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])

**Answer**: Option 5

We need the average cost per piece at each house.

The correct formula would be: (total spent on candy) / (total pieces of candy)

Let's go through each Way and assess if it is valid or not. 

**Way 1**: When we sum the "price" column directly, we're summing the per-piece prices, not the total spent. This gives wrong totals. For example, if a house has 30 pieces at $0.20 and 20 at $0.10, summing prices gives $0.30 instead of $8.00.

**Way 2**: This first calculates price/quantity for each candy type, then takes the mean of these ratios. This is mathematically incorrect for finding average cost per piece.

- For Twix: $0.20/30 = $0.00667 per piece
- For Laffy Taffy: $0.10/20 = $0.005 per piece
- Takes mean: ($0.00667 + $0.005)/2 = $0.00583
- This is wrong because it's taking mean of ratios instead of ratio of totals

**Way 3**: Similar to Way 2, but even more problematic as it divides by quantity twice.

- For Twix: $0.20/30 = $0.00667
- For Laffy Taffy: $0.10/20 = $0.005
- Sums these: $0.00667 + $0.005 = $0.01167
- Divides by total quantity again: $0.01167/50 = $0.000233

**Way 4**: Correctly calculates total spent (x = quantity * price) but then takes the mean of the totals instead of dividing by total quantity.

- For Twix: 30 × $0.20 = $6.00
- For Laffy Taffy: 20 × $0.10 = $2.00
- Takes mean of these totals: ($6.00 + $2.00)/2 = $4.00 (wrong)
- This is wrong because it takes mean of totals instead of dividing by total quantity

**Way 5**: This is correct because:

- First calculates total spent on each candy type (quantity * price per piece)
- Groups by address and sums both the total spent and total quantities
- Finally divides total spent by total pieces to get average cost per piece

Using our example:

- 30 Twix at $0.20 = $6.00
- 20 Laffy Taffy at $0.10 = $2.00
- Total spent = $8.00
- Total pieces = 50
- Average = $8.00/50 = $0.16 per piece, the correct answer.
