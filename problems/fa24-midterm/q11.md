As in the last problem, we'll continue working with the `tot` DataFrame
that came from merging `trick` with `treat`. The `"price"` column
contains the cost in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy,
as a `float`.

In this problem, we want to use `tot` to calculate the **average cost
per piece** of Halloween candy at each house. For example, suppose one
house has 30 Twix, which cost $\$0.20$ each, and 20 Laffy Taffy, which
cost $\$0.10$ each. Then this house spent $\$8.00$ on 50 pieces of
candy, for an average cost of $\$0.16$ per piece.

Which of the following correctly sets `ac` to a DataFrame indexed by
`"address"` with a column called `"avg_cost"` that contains the average
cost per piece of Halloween candy at each address? Select all that
apply.

Way 1:

    ac = tot.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("price") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 2:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("price") / tot.get("how_many"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x").mean()).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 3:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("price") / tot.get("how_many"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 4:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("how_many") * tot.get("price"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x").mean()).get(["avg_cost"])

Way 5:

    ac = tot.assign(x = tot.get("how_many") * tot.get("price"))
    ac = ac.groupby("address").sum()
    ac = ac.assign(avg_cost = ac.get("x") / 
                              ac.get("how_many")).get(["avg_cost"])
