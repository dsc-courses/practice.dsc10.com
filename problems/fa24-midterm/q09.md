# BEGIN PROB

Assume that all houses in `treat` give out the same size candy, say
fun-sized. Suppose we have an additional DataFrame, `trick`, which is
indexed by `"candy"` and has one column, `"price"`, containing the cost
in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy, as a `float`.

Suppose that:

-   `treat` has 200 rows total, and includes 15 distinct types of
    candies.

-   `trick` has 25 rows total: 15 for the candies that appear in
    `treat`, plus 10 additional rows that correspond to candies not
    represented in `treat`.

Consider the following line of code:

    trick_or_treat = trick.merge(treat, left_index = True, right_on = "candy")

How many rows does `trick_or_treat` have?

( ) $15$
( ) $25$
( ) $200$
( ) $215$
( ) $225$
( ) $3000$
( ) $5000$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: 200

We are told that `trick` has 25 rows: 15 from candies that are in `treat` and 10 additional candies. 
This means that each candy in `trick` appears exactly once because 15+10= 25. In addition, a general
property when merging dataframes is that the number of rows for one shared value between the dataframes is 
the product of the number of occurences in either dataframe. For example, if Twix occurs 5 times
in `treat`, the number of times it occurs in `trick_or_treat` is 5 * 1 = 5 (it occurs once in `trick`). 
Using this logic, we can determine how many rows are in `trick_or_treat`. Since each number of candies is multipled by one and they sum up to 200, the number of rows will be 200.
