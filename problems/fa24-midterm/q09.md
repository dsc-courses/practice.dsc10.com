Assume that all houses in `treat` give out the same size candy, say
fun-sized. Suppose we have an additional DataFrame, `trick`, which is
indexed by `"candy"` and has one column, `"price"`, containing the cost
in dollars of a **single piece** of fun-sized candy, as a `float`.

Suppose that:

-   `treat` has 200 rows total, and includes 15 distinct types of
    candies.

-   `trick` has 25 rows total: 15 for the candies that appear in
    `treat`, plus 10 additional rows that correspond to candies not
    represented in `treat`.

Consider the following line of code:

    trick_or_treat = trick.merge(treat, left_index = True, right_on = "candy")

How many rows does `trick_or_treat` have?

( ) $15$
( ) $25$
( ) $200$
( ) $215$
( ) $225$
( ) $3000$
( ) $5000$
