# BEGIN PROB

Consider the code below.

```py
street = treats.get("address").str.contains("Street")
sour = treats.get("candy").str.contains("Sour")
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the data type of `street`?

( ) `int`
( ) `bool`
( ) `str`
( ) Series
( ) DataFrame

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Series

.str.contains works in a series and returns a series of booleans. Each entry is `True` if it contains a certain string or `False` otherwise. So the answer is `street` has the Series data type.

What does the following expression evaluate to? Write your answer
**exactly** how the output would appear in Python.

```py
np.count_nonzero(street & sour) > sour.sum()
```

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `False`

`np.count_nonzero(street & sour)` counts the number of rows that contains the word "Street" in the `address` column AND also contains the word "Sour" in `candy`. `sour.sum()` sums up all the trues and falses, effectively making it a count of rows that contain the word "Sour" in `candy`. 
Even if we don't know the full dataframe, we should be able to figure out that the number of rows that satisfy the condition of both `Street` AND `Sour` should be lower than or equal to the number of rows that satisfy `Sour` by itself. 
Therefore, it's impossible for `np.count_nonzero(street & sour) > sour.sum()` to be `True` so the answer is `False`.
