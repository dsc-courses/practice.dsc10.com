# BEGIN PROB

Write a Python expression that evaluates to the address of the house
with the most pieces of candy available (the most **pieces**, not the
most varieties).

It's okay if you need to write on multiple lines, but your code should
represent a single expression in Python.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `treat.groupby("address").sum().sort_values(by="how_many", ascending = False).index[0]` or `treat.groupby("addresss").sum().sort_values(by="how_many").index[-1]`

In the `treat` DataFrame, there are multiple rows for each address, one for each candy they are giving out with their quantity. Since we want the address with the most pieces of candy available, we need to combine this information, so we start by grouping by address: `treat.groupby(“address”)`. Now, since we want to add the number of candy available per address, we use the `sum()` aggregate function. So now we have a DataFrame with one row per address where there value in each column is the sum of all the values. To get the address with the most pieces of candy available, we can simply sort by the `“how_many”` column since this stores the total amount of candy per house. Setting `ascending=False` means that the address with the greatest amount of candy will be the first row. Since the addresses are located in the index as a result of the `groupby`, we can access this value by using `index[0]`.

Note: If you do not set `ascending=False`, then the address with the most amount of candy available will be the last row which you can access by `index[-1]`.
