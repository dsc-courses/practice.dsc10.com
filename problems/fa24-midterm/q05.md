# BEGIN PROB

Write a Python expression that evaluates to the address of the house
with the most pieces of candy available (the most **pieces**, not the
most varieties).

It's okay if you need to write on multiple lines, but your code should
represent a single expression in Python.


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `treat.groupby("address").sum().sort_values(by="how_many", ascending = False).index[0]` or `treat.groupby("addresss").sum().sort_values(by="how_many").index[-1]`

<average>67</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END PROB
