# BEGIN PROB

Which of the following columns would be an appropriate index for the
`treat` DataFrame?

( ) `"address"`
( ) `"candy"`
( ) `"neighborhood"`
( ) None of these.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: None of these.

The index uniquely identifies each row of a DataFrame. As a result, for a column to be a candidate for the index, it must not contain repeat items. Since it is possible for an address to give out different types of candy, values in `"address"` can show up multiple times. Similarly, values in `"candy"` can also show up multiple times as it will appear anytime a house gives it out. Finally, a neighborhood has multiple houses, so if more than one of those houses show up, that value in `"neighborhood"` will appear multiple times. Since `"address"`, `"candy"`, and `"neighborhood"` can potentially have repeat values, none of them can be the index for `treat`.
