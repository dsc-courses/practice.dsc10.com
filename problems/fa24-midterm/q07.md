Suppose you visit another house and their candy bowl is composed of 2
Twix, 3 Rolos, 1 Snickers, 3 M&Ms, and 1 KitKat. You do the same as
before and take 3 candies from the bowl at random.

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `prob_all_same` evaluates
to an estimate of the probability that you get three of the same type of
candy.

        candy_bowl = np.array(["Twix", "Twix", "Rolo", "Rolo", "Rolo", "Snickers", "M&M", "M&M", "M&M", "KitKat"])

        repetitions = 10000
        prob_all_same = 0
        for i in np.arange(repetitions):
            grab = np.random.choice(___(a)___)
            if ___(b)___:
                prob_all_same = prob_all_same + 1
        prob_all_same = ___(c)___

What goes in blank (a)?

( ) `candy_bowl, len(candy_bowl), replace=False`
( ) `candy_bowl, 3, replace=False`
( ) `candy_bowl, 3, replace=True`
( ) `candy_bowl, repetitions, replace=True`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `candy_bowl, 3, replace=False`

<average>88</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (b)?

( ) `grab[0] == "Rolo" and grab[1] == "Rolo" and grab[2] == "Rolo"`
( ) `grab[0] == grab[1] and grab[0] == grab[2]`
( ) `grab[0] == grab[1] or grab[0] == grab[2]`
( ) `grab == "Rolo" | grab == "M&M"`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `grab[0] == grab[1] and grab[0] == grab[2]`

<average>92</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What goes in blank (c)?

( ) `prob_all_same.mean()`
( ) `prob_all_same / len(candy_bowl)`
( ) `prob_all_same / repetitions`
( ) `prob_all_same / 3`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: `prob_all_same / repetitions`

<average>86</average>
