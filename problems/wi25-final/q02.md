The Death Eaters are a powerful group of dark wizards who oppose Harry
Potter and his allies. Each Death Eater receives a unique identification
number based on their order of initiation, ranging from `1` to `N`,
where `N` represents the total number of Death Eaters.

Your task is to estimate the value of `N` so you can understand how many
enemies you face. You have a random sample of identification numbers in
a DataFrame named `death_eaters` containing a single column called
`"ID"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the options below would be an appropriate estimate for the
total number of Death Eaters? Select all that apply.

[ ] `death_eaters.get("ID").max()`
[ ] `death_eaters.get("ID").sum()`
[ ] `death_eaters.groupby("ID").count()`
[ ] `int(death_eaters.get("ID").mean() * 2)`
[ ] `death_eaters.shape[0]`
[ ] None of the above.

Each box that you selected in part (a) is an example of what?

( ) a distribution

( ) a parameter 
( ) a resample

Suppose you have access to a function called `estimate`, which takes in
a Series of Death Eater ID numbers and returns an estimate for `N`. Fill
in the blanks below to do the following:

-   Create an array named `boot_estimates`, containing 10,000 of these
    bootstrapped estimates of `N`, based on the data in `death_eaters`.

-   Set `left_72` to the **left endpoint** of a 72% confidence interval
    for `N`.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
        boot_estimates = np.array([])
        
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            boot_estimates = np.append(boot_estimates, __(a)__)

        left_72 = __(b)__
