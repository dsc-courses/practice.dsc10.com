While browsing the library, Hermione stumbles upon an old book
containing game logs for all Quidditch matches played at Hogwarts in the
18th century. Quidditch is a sport played between two houses. It
features three types of balls:

-   **Quaffle**: Worth 10 points when used to score a goal.

-   **Bludger**: Does not contribute points. Instead, used to distract
    the other team.

-   **Snitch**: Worth 150 points when caught. This immediately ends the
    game.

A game log is a list of actions that occurred during a Quidditch match.
Each element of a game log is a two-letter string where the first letter
represents the house that performed the action (`"G"` for Gryffindor, ,
`"H"` for Hufflepuff, `"R"` for Ravenclaw, `"S"` for Slytherin) and the
second letter indicates the type of Quidditch ball used in the action
(`"Q"` for Quaffle, `"B"` for Bludger, `"S"` for Snitch). For example,
`"RQ"` in a game log represents Ravenclaw scoring with the Quaffle to
earn 10 points.

Hermione writes a function, `logwarts`, to calculate the final score of
a Quidditch match based on the actions in the game log. The inputs are a
game log (a list, as described above) and the full names of the two
houses competing. The output is a list of length 4 containing the names
of the teams and their corresponding scores. Example behavior is given
below.

        >>> logwarts(["RQ", "GQ", "RB", "GS"], "Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw")
        ["Gryffindor", 160, "Ravenclaw", 10]

        >>> logwarts(["HB", "HQ", "HQ", "SS"], "Hufflepuff", "Slytherin")
        ["Hufflepuff", 20, "Slytherin", 150]

Fill in the blanks in the `logwarts` function below. Note that some of
your answers are **used in more than one place** in the code.

        def logwarts(game_log, team1, team2):
            score1 = __(a)__
            score2 = __(a)__

            for action in game_log:
                house = __(b)__
                ball = __(c)__
                
                if __(d)__: 
                    __(e)__:
                        score1 = score1 + 10
                    __(f)__:
                        score1 = score1 + 150
                else:
                    __(e)__:
                        score2 = score2 + 10
                    __(f)__:
                        score2 = score2 + 150
            return [team1, score1, team2, score2]

What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `0`** 

First inspect the function parameters. With the example `logwarts(["RQ", "GQ", "RB", "GS"], "Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw")`, we observe `game_log` will be a list of strings, and `team1` and `team2` will be the full name of the respective competing houses. We can infer from the given structure that our code will 

1. Initialize two scores variables for the two houses, 

2. Run a for loop through all the entries in the list, update score based on given conditions, 

3. Return the scores calculated by the loop. 

To set up `score_1` and `score_2` so we can accumulate them in the for loop, we first set both equal to 0. So blank (a) will be `0`.

What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `action[0]`** 

We observe the for loop iterates over the list of actions, where each `action` is a **two letter string** in the `game_log` array. Recall question statement- "Each element of a game log is a two-letter string where the first letter
represents the house that performed the action". Therefore, to get the house, we will want to get the first letter of each action string. This is accessed by `action[0]`. 

Note: A common mistake here is using `action.split()[0]`. [Recall what `split()` does](https://dsc-courses.github.io/bpd-reference/docs/documentation/string-methods/str.split()/) - it takes in a string, splits it according to the delimiter given (if not given, it separates by blank space), and returns a **list** of separated strings. This means that `action.split()[0]` will actually return itself. Example: if `action` is `"RQ"`, `action.split()` will split `"RQ"` by blank space, in this case, there are none; so it will return the one-element list `["RQ"]`. Accessing the zero-th index of this list by `action.split()[0]` gives us `"RQ"` back, instead of what we actually want (`"R"`).

What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `action[1]`** 

Following the same logic as blank (b), we get the type of ball used in the action by accessing the second character of the string, which is `action[1]`.

What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `house == team1[0]`** 

Now enter the fun part: to figure out the correct conditions of the if-statments, we must observe the code inside our conditional blocks carefully. 

Recall question statement: 

- For each entry of the game log, the house is represented by the first letter. "G" for Griffindor, "H" for Hufflepuff, "R" for Ravenclaw, "S" for Slytherin. 

- Quaffle ("Q") gets 10 points,

- Snitch ("S") gets 150 points, 

- Bludger ("B") gets no point. 

- `score1` is the score of the first team, and `score2` is the score of the second. 

We have two conditions to take care of, the house and the type of ball. How on earth do we know which one is nested and which one is on the outside? Observe in the first big if statment, we are only updating `score1`. This means this block takes care of the score of the first house. Therefore, blank (d) should set the condition for the first house. 

Now careful! `team1` and `team2` are given as full house names. We can match the `house` variable by getting the first letter of the each team string (e.g. if `team1` is Griffindor, we will get "G" to match with "G").  We want to match `house` with `team1[0]`, so our final answer is  `house == team1[0]`. Since there are only two houses here, the following `else` block will take care of calculating score for the second house using the same scoring scheme as we do for the first house.

What goes in blank (e)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `if ball == "Q"`** 

After gracefully handling the outer conditional statement, the rest is simple. We now simply condition the scores. Here, we see score1 increments by 10, so we know this is accounting for a Quaffle. Recall `ball` variable represents the type of ball we have. In this case, we use  `if ball == "Q"` to filter for Quaffles.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (f)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `elif ball == "S"` or `if ball == "S"`** 

Using the same logic as blank (e), since the score is incremented by 150 here, we know this is a snitch. Using `elif ball == "S"` or `if ball == "S"` will serve the purpose. We do not need to worry about bludgers, since those do not add to the score.
