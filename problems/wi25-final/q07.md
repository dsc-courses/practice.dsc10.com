Professor Minerva McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, may also be awarding
house points unfairly. For this question, we'll assume that all four of
the houses contain the same number of students, and we'll investigate
whether McGonagall awards points equally to all four houses.

Below is the distribution of points that Professor McGonagall awarded
during the last academic year.

You want to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of points awarded by Professor
    McGonagall is uniform across all of the houses.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The distribution of points awarded by
    Professor McGonagall is not uniform across all of the houses.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following test statistics is appropriate for this
hypothesis test? Select all that apply.

[ ] The absolute difference between the number of points awarded to Gryffindor and the proposed proportion of points awarded to Gryffindor.
[ ] The difference between the number of points awarded to the house with the most points and the house with the least points.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`.
[ ] The sum of the differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 2 and 5.

This problem is trying to find test statistics that can be used to distinguish when the data is better supported by the alternative. Since the alternative hypothesis simply states "is not uniform across all of the houses", it is not crucial to look for individual differences between houses but rather the general relationship of points awarded to all houses.

**Option 1:** This option only tells us information about Gryffindor but doesn't tell us anything about inequalities between other houses. For example,e if Gryffindor received 25% of the points and Slytherin received the other 75% of the points we would not be able to tell this apart from the case when all houses received 25% of the points.

**Option 2:** When the points are distributed normally we would expect that all the houses receive about the same amount and therefore the difference of points would be near 0. However, if one house is gaining more points than the rest of the houses then the number of points between the top and lowest house we be greater than 0. Therefore we are "measuring" the alternative. 

**Option 3:** This test statistic measures the sum of the squared differences in proportions between McGonagallâ€™s distribution and [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]. However, [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5] does not represent a valid probability distribution because the total sum exceeds 1. As a result, this test statistic is not meaningful in assessing whether the point distribution is uniform across houses.  

**Option 4:** When we measure the sum of the differences, the information on "how close" the data is to the alternative can be unseen. For example, a distribution of [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] is what we'd expect under the null and a distribution of [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5] would support the alternative. However, using this test statistic we would see a result of 0.0 therefore not differentiating them. 

**Option 5:** Under the null hypothesis [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] is the "expected" distribution. Additionally, since the alternative hypothesis states that McGongall's assignments are not uniform (aka is the distribution of points non-uniform), a house supports the alternative if its points are significantly less than ***or*** greater than 0.25. Squaring the differences allows the test statistic to be greater in either case and therefore would be a valid statistic.

Choose the correct way to implement the function `calculate_test_stat`,
which takes in two distributions as arrays and returns the value of this
test statistic.

        def calculate_test_stat(dist_1, dist_2):
            return _____

( ) `np.abs(sum(dist_1 - dist_2))`.
( ) `abs(sum(dist_1 - dist_2))`.
( ) `sum(np.abs(dist_1 - dist_2))`. 
( ) `sum(abs(dist_1 - dist_2))`.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `sum(np.abs(dist_1 - dist_2))`

A valid test statistic in this problem would find how far dist_1 differs from dist_2. Since we're looking at ["how different"](https://dsc-courses.github.io/bpd-reference/docs/statistical-inference/permutation_test/#code-example-absolute-difference) the distributions are, we need to take the absolute value (aka a measure of distance/difference) and then add them up. np.abs() needs to be used over abs() because dist_1 and dist_2 are numpy arrays of proportions.

(10 pts) Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `simulated_ts` is
an array containing 10,000 simulated values of the test statistic under
the null. Note that your answer to blank `(c)` is **used in more than
one place** in the code.

        mc_gon = np.arange(__(a)__) # Careful: np.arange, not np.array!
        null = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])
        observed_ts = calculate_test_stat(__(b)__)

What goes in blank (a)?
# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.1, 0.5, 0.1 (or equivalent)

Based on the distribution shown in the bar chart above, we want our resulting array to contain the proportions `[0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]` (40/100 for Gryffindor, 20/100 for Hufflepuff, 30/100 for Ravenclaw, and 10/100 for Slytherin). Note that the order of these proportions does not matter because: 1) we are calculating the absolute difference between each value and the null proportion (0.25), and 2) we will sum all the differences together.

Since these proportions are incrementally increasing, we can use `np.arange()` to construct `mc_gon`. There are multiple correct approaches to this problem, as long as the resulting array contains all four proportions. Some alternative correct approaches include:
- `np.arange(0.4, 0.0, -0.1)`
- `np.arange(0.1, 0.41, 0.1)` (The middle argument can be any value greater than 0.4 and less than or equal to 0.5)

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 100

Blank (c) represents the total number of trials in each simulated sample. Using 100 ensures that each sample is large enough to approximate the expected proportions while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, (c) is used to divide all values, converting counts into proportions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `null`

Blank (d) is null because each simulated sample is generated under the null hypothesis. This means the probabilities used in `np.random.multinomial` should match the expected proportions from the null distribution.

Fill in the blank so that `reject_null` evaluates to `True` if we reject
the null hypothesis at the $0.05$ significance level, and `False`
otherwise.

        reject_null = __(f)__


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `(simulated_ts >= observed_ts).mean() <= 0.05`

reject_null should evaluate to a boolean statement therefore we must test whether our [p-value](https://dsc-courses.github.io/bpd-reference/docs/statistical-inference/p_value/) is less than or equal to 0.05. Taking the mean of `(simulated_ts >= observed_ts)` tells us the proportion of simulated test statistics that are equal to the value that was observed in the data or is even further in the direction of the alternative.

Your friend performs the same hypothesis test as you, but uses the total
variation distance (TVD) as their test statistic instead of the one
described in the problem. Which of the following statements is true?

( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be larger than yours, because TVD accounts for the magnitude *and* direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be larger than yours, but **not** because it accounts for the magnitude and direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be smaller than yours, because TVD accounts for the magnitude *and* direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be smaller than yours, but **not** because it accounts for the magnitude and direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) There is no relationship between the statistic you used and the statistic your friend used (TVD).

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** Option 4.

[TVD](https://dsc-courses.github.io/bpd-reference/docs/statistical-inference/obs_and_test_stats/#3-total-variation-distance-tvd) is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute differences of two proportions, all divided by 2. Therefore the only difference between TVD and our test statistic is the fact that TVD is divided by 2 (which would make it smaller). Meaning that the reason it is smaller is **not** related to magnitude or direction.
