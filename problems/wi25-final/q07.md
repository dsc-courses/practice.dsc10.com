Professor Minerva McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, may also be awarding
house points unfairly. For this question, we'll assume that all four of
the houses contain the same number of students, and we'll investigate
whether McGonagall awards points equally to all four houses.

Below is the distribution of points that Professor McGonagall awarded
during the last academic year.

You want to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The distribution of points awarded by Professor
    McGonagall is uniform across all of the houses.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The distribution of points awarded by
    Professor McGonagall is not uniform across all of the houses.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following test statistics is appropriate for this
hypothesis test? Select all that apply.

[ ] The absolute difference between the number of points awarded to Gryffindor and the proposed proportion of points awarded to Gryffindor.
[ ] The difference between the number of points awarded to the house with the most points and the house with the least points.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`.
[ ] The sum of the differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.
[ ] The sum of the squared differences in proportions between McGonagall's distribution and `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.
[ ] None of the above.

For the rest of this problem, we will use the following test statistic:

**The sum of the absolute differences in proportions between
McGonagall's distribution and `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.**

Choose the correct way to implement the function `calculate_test_stat`,
which takes in two distributions as arrays and returns the value of this
test statistic.

        def calculate_test_stat(dist_1, dist_2):
            return _____

( ) `np.abs(sum(dist_1 - dist_2))`.
( ) `abs(sum(dist_1 - dist_2))`.
( ) `sum(np.abs(dist_1 - dist_2))`. 
( ) `sum(abs(dist_1 - dist_2))`.

(10 pts) Fill in the blanks in the code below so that `simulated_ts` is
an array containing 10,000 simulated values of the test statistic under
the null. Note that your answer to blank `(c)` is **used in more than
one place** in the code.

        mc_gon = np.arange(__(a)__) # Careful: np.arange, not np.array!
        null = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])
        observed_ts = calculate_test_stat(__(b)__)

        simulated_ts = np.array([])

        for i in np.arange(10000):
            sim = np.random.multinomial(__(c)__, __(d)__) / __(c)__

Fill in the blank so that `reject_null` evaluates to `True` if we reject
the null hypothesis at the $0.05$ significance level, and `False`
otherwise.

Your friend performs the same hypothesis test as you, but uses the total
variation distance (TVD) as their test statistic instead of the one
described in the problem. Which of the following statements is true?

( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be larger than yours, because TVD accounts for the magnitude *and* direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be larger than yours, but **not** because it accounts for the magnitude and direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be smaller than yours, because TVD accounts for the magnitude *and* direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) Your friend's simulated statistics will be smaller than yours, but **not** because it accounts for the magnitude and direction of the differences in proportions.
( ) There is no relationship between the statistic you used and the statistic your friend used (TVD).
