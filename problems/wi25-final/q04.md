Beneath Gringotts Wizarding Bank, enchanted mine carts transport wizards
through a complex underground railway on the way to their bank vault.

During one section of the journey to Harry's vault, the track follows
the shape of a normal curve, with a peak at $x = 50$ and a standard
deviation of $20$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A ferocious dragon, who lives under this section of the railway, is
equally likely to be located anywhere within this region. What is the
probability that the dragon is located in a position with $x \leq 10$ or
$x \geq 80$? Select all that apply.

[ ] `1 - (scipy.stats.norm.cdf(1.5) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2))`
[ ] `2 * scipy.stats.norm.cdf(1.75)`
[ ] `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2) + scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-1.5)`
[ ] 0.95
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: `1 - (scipy.stats.norm.cdf(1.5) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2))` & `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2) + scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-1.5)`**

- **Option 1**: This code calculates the probability that a value lies outside the range between $z = -2$ and $z = 1.5$, which corresponds to $x \leq 10$ or $x \geq 80$. This is done by subtracting the area under the normal curve between -2 and 1.5 from 1. This is correct because it accurately captures the combined probability in the left and right tails of the distribution.

- **Option 2**: This code multiplies the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at $z = 1.75$ by 2. This assumes symmetry around the mean and is used for intervals like $|z| \geq 1.75$, but that’s not what we want. The correct $z$-values for this problem are $-2$ and $1.5$, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option 3**: This code adds the probability of $z \leq -2$ and $z \geq 1.5$, using the fact that $P(z \geq 1.5) = P(z \leq -1.5)$ by symmetry. So, while the code appears to show both as left-tail calculations, it actually produces the correct total tail probability. This option is correct.

- **Option 4**: This is a static value with no basis in the $z$-scores of $-2$ and $1.5$. It’s likely meant as a distractor and does not represent the correct probability for the specified conditions. This option is incorrect.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Harry wants to know where, in this section of the track, the cart's
height is changing the fastest. He knows from his earlier public school
education that the height changes the fastest at the **inflection
points** of a normal distribution. Where are the inflection points in
this section of the track?

( ) $x = 50$
( ) $x = 20$ and $x = 80$
( ) $x = 30$ and $x = 70$
( ) $x = 0$ and $x = 100$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: $x = 30$ and $x = 70$**

Recall that the inflection points of a normal distribution are located one standard deviation away from the mean. In this problem, the mean is $x = 50$ and the standard deviation is $20$, so the inflection points occur at $x = 30$ and $x = 70$. These are the points where the curve changes concavity and where the height is changing the fastest. Therefore, the correct answer is $x = 30$ and $x = 70$.

Next, consider a different region of the track, where the shape follows
some arbitrary distribution with mean $130$ and standard deviation $30$.
We don't have any information about the shape of the distribution, so it
is not necessarily normal.

What is the minimum proportion of area under this section of the track
within the range $100 \leq x \leq 190$?

( ) 0.77
( ) 0.55
( ) 0.38
( ) 0.00

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: 0.00**

We are told that the distribution is not necessarily normal. The mean is 130 and the standard deviation is 30. We're asked for the minimum proportion of area between $x = 100$ and $x = 190$.

Since the distribution isn’t normal and we don’t know its shape, we can’t use the empirical rule (68-95-99.7) or z-scores. We might try using Chebyshev’s Inequality, but that only works for intervals that are equally far below the mean as above the mean. This interval is not like that (it's 1 standard deviation below the mean and 2 above), so Chebyshev’s Inequality doesn’t apply. The most we can say using Chebyshev's Inequality is that in the interval from 1 standard deviation below the mean to 1 standard deviation above the mean, we can get at least $1 - \frac{1}{0^2} = 0$ percent of the data. We can't make any additional guarantees. So, the minimum possible proportion of area is 0.00.
