Beneath Gringotts Wizarding Bank, enchanted mine carts transport wizards
through a complex underground railway on the way to their bank vault.

During one section of the journey to Harry's vault, the track follows
the shape of a normal curve, with a peak at $x = 50$ and a standard
deviation of $20$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

A ferocious dragon, who lives under this section of the railway, is
equally likely to be located anywhere within this region. What is the
probability that the dragon is located in a position with $x \leq 10$ or
$x \geq 80$? Select all that apply.

[ ] `1 - (scipy.stats.norm.cdf(1.5) - scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2))`
[ ] `2 * scipy.stats.norm.cdf(1.75)`
[ ] `scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-2) + scipy.stats.norm.cdf(-1.5)`
[ ] 0.95
[ ] None of the above.

Harry wants to know where, in this section of the track, the cart's
height is changing the fastest. He knows from his earlier public school
education that the height changes the fastest at the **inflection
points** of a normal distribution. Where are the inflection points in
this section of the track?

( ) $x = 50$
( ) $x = 20$ and $x = 80$
( ) $x = 30$ and $x = 70$
( ) $x = 0$ and $x = 100$

Next, consider a different region of the track, where the shape follows
some arbitrary distribution with mean $130$ and standard deviation $30$.
We don't have any information about the shape of the distribution, so it
is not necessarily normal.

What is the minimum proportion of area under this section of the track
within the range $100 \leq x \leq 190$?

( ) 0.77
( ) 0.55
( ) 0.38
( ) 0.00
