Among Hogwarts students, Chocolate Frogs are a popular enchanted treat.
Chocolate Frogs are individually packaged, and every Chocolate Frog
comes with a collectible card of a famous wizard (ex."Albus
Dumbledore\"). There are 80 unique cards, and each package contains
**one card selected uniformly at random from these 80**.

Neville would love to get a complete collection with all 80 cards, and
he wants to know how many Chocolate Frogs he should expect to buy to
make this happen.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we have access to a function called `frog_experiment` that takes
no inputs and simulates the act of buying Chocolate Frogs until a
complete collection of cards is obtained. The function returns the
number of Chocolate Frogs that were purchased. Fill in the blanks below
to run 10,000 simulations and set `avg_frog_count` to the average number
of Chocolate Frogs purchased across these experiments.

        frog_counts = np.array([])  
        
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            frog_counts = np.append(__(a)__)
        
        avg_frog_count = __(b)__

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Realistically, Neville can only afford to buy 300 Chocolate Frog cards.
Using the simulated data in `frog_counts`, write a Python expression
that evaluates to an approximation of the probability that Neville will
be able to complete his collection.

**True or False**: The Central Limit Theorem states that the data in
`frog_counts` is roughly normally distributed.

( ) True 
( ) False
