Among Hogwarts students, Chocolate Frogs are a popular enchanted treat.
Chocolate Frogs are individually packaged, and every Chocolate Frog
comes with a collectible card of a famous wizard (ex."Albus
Dumbledore\"). There are 80 unique cards, and each package contains
**one card selected uniformly at random from these 80**.

Neville would love to get a complete collection with all 80 cards, and
he wants to know how many Chocolate Frogs he should expect to buy to
make this happen.

Suppose we have access to a function called `frog_experiment` that takes
no inputs and simulates the act of buying Chocolate Frogs until a
complete collection of cards is obtained. The function returns the
number of Chocolate Frogs that were purchased. Fill in the blanks below
to run 10,000 simulations and set `avg_frog_count` to the average number
of Chocolate Frogs purchased across these experiments.

        frog_counts = np.array([])  
        
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            frog_counts = np.append(__(a)__)
        
        avg_frog_count = __(b)__


# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `frog_counts, frog_experiment()`

Each call to `frog_experiment()` simulates purchasing Chocolate Frogs until a complete set of 80 unique cards is obtained, returning the total number of frogs purchased in that simulation. The result of each simulation is then appended to the `frog_counts` array.

<average>65</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `frog_counts.mean()`

After running the loop for 10000 times, the `frog_counts` array holds all the simulated totals. Taking the mean of that array (`frog_counts.mean()`) gives the average number of frogs needed to complete the set of 80 unique cards.

<average>89</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Realistically, Neville can only afford to buy 300 Chocolate Frog cards.
Using the simulated data in `frog_counts`, write a Python expression
that evaluates to an approximation of the probability that Neville will
be able to complete his collection.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** `np.count_nonzero(frog_counts <= 300) / len(frog_counts)` or equivlent, such as `np.count_nonzero(frog_counts <= 300) / 10000` or `(frog_counts <= 300).mean()`

In the simulated data, each entry of `frog_counts` is the number of Chocolate Frogs purchased in one simulation before collecting all 80 unique cards. We want to estimate the probability that Neville completes his collection with at most 300 cards.

`frog_counts <= 300` creates a boolean array of the same length as `frog_counts`, where each element is True if the number of frogs used in that simulation was 300 or fewer, and False otherwise.

`np.count_nonzero(frog_counts <= 300)` counts how many simulations (out of all the simulations) met the condition since `True` evaluates to 1 and `False` evaluates to 0.

Dividing by the total number of simulations, `len(frog_counts)`, converts that count to probability. 

<average>59</average>

**True or False**: The Central Limit Theorem states that the data in
`frog_counts` is roughly normally distributed.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** False

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the probability distribution of the sum or mean of a large random sample drawn with replacement will be roughly normal, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the sample is drawn.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) does not claim that individual observations are normally distributed. In this problem, each entry of `frog_counts` is a single observation: the number of frogs purchased in one simulation to complete the collection. There is no requirement that these individual data points themselves follow a normal distribution. 

However, if we repeatedly take many samples of such observations and compute the sample mean, then that mean would tend toward a normal distribution as the sample size grows, follows the CLT.

<average>38</average>
