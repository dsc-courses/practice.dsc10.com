The Triwizard Tournament is an international competition between three
wizarding academies: Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.

In a Triwizard Tournament, wizards from each school compete in three
dangerous magical challenges. If one school wins two or more challenges,
that school is the **tournament champion**. Otherwise, there is no
champion, since each school won a single challenge.

The DataFrame `triwiz` has a row for each challenge from the first 20
Triwizard Tournaments. With 20 tournaments each having 3 challenges,
`triwiz` has **exactly 60 rows**. The first six rows are shown below.

The columns are:

-   `"Year" (int)`: Triwizard Tournaments are held only once every five
    years.

-   `"Host" (str)`: Triwizard Tournaments are held at one of the three
    participating schools on a rotating basis: Hogwarts, Durmstrang,
    Beauxbatons, back to Hogwarts again, etc.

-   `"Challenge" (int)`: Either `1`, `2`, or `3`.

-   `"Winner" (str)`: The school that won the challenge.

(10 pts) Fill in the blanks below to create the DataFrame `champions`,
which is indexed by `"Winner"` and has just one column, `"Year"`,
containing **the number of years in which each school was the tournament
champion**. `champions` is shown in full below.

Note that the values in the `"Year"` column add up to 14, not 20. That
means there were 6 years in which there was a tie (for example, 1299 was
one such year).

        grouped = triwiz.groupby(__(a)__).__(b)__.__(c)__
        filtered = grouped[__(d)__] 
        champions = filtered.groupby(__(e)__).__(f)__.__(g)__
