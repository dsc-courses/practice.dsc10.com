# BEGIN PROB

The Triwizard Tournament is an international competition between three
wizarding academies: Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.

In a Triwizard Tournament, wizards from each school compete in three
dangerous magical challenges. If one school wins two or more challenges,
that school is the **tournament champion**. Otherwise, there is no
champion, since each school won a single challenge.

The DataFrame `triwiz` has a row for each challenge from the first 20
Triwizard Tournaments. With 20 tournaments each having 3 challenges,
`triwiz` has **exactly 60 rows**. The first six rows are shown below.

The columns are:

-   `"Year" (int)`: Triwizard Tournaments are held only once every five
    years.

-   `"Host" (str)`: Triwizard Tournaments are held at one of the three
    participating schools on a rotating basis: Hogwarts, Durmstrang,
    Beauxbatons, back to Hogwarts again, etc.

-   `"Challenge" (int)`: Either `1`, `2`, or `3`.

-   `"Winner" (str)`: The school that won the challenge.


# BEGIN SUBPROB

(10 pts) Fill in the blanks below to create the DataFrame `champions`,
which is indexed by `"Winner"` and has just one column, `"Year"`,
containing **the number of years in which each school was the tournament
champion**. `champions` is shown in full below.

<center><img src='../assets/images/wi25-final/champions.jpg' width=400></center>

Note that the values in the `"Year"` column add up to 14, not 20. That
means there were 6 years in which there was a tie (for example, 1299 was
one such year).

        grouped = triwiz.groupby(__(a)__).__(b)__.__(c)__
        filtered = grouped[__(d)__] 
        champions = filtered.groupby(__(e)__).__(f)__.__(g)__


What goes in blank (a)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `["Year", "Winner"]` or `["Winner", "Year"]`  

Grouping by both the `"Year"` and `"Winner"` columns ensures that each school's win in a given year is represented as a single row.

<average>89</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (b)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `count()`

Since each winner in a given year appears as a single row, we use `count()` to determine how many times each school won that year.

<average>90</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (c)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `reset_index()`

Grouping by multiple columns creates a multi-index. `reset_index()` flattens the DataFrame back to normal, where each row represents a given year for each winning school.

<average>80</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (d)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `grouped.get("Host") != 1` or `grouped.get("Host") > 1` or `grouped.get("Host") >= 2`

The Triwizard Tournament winner is defined as a school that wins two or more challenges in a given year. After grouping with `.count()`, all other columns contain the same value, which is the number of challenges each **winning** school won that year. A school will not appear in this DataFrame if they did not win any challenges that year, so we only need to check if the value in the other columns is not 1.  
`.get("Challenge")` is also valid because all other columns contain the same value.

<average>71</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (e)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `"Winner"`

The resulting DataFrame should be indexed by `"Winner"`, therefore the DataFrame is grouped by the `"Winner"` column. 

<average>90</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (f)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `count()`

Grouping with `.count()` again ensures that the resulting columns represent the number of times each `"Winner"` (school) in the index won across all years.

<average>84</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
What goes in blank (g)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** `get(["Year"])`

The question asks for a DataFrame with `"Year"` as the only column, so brackets are used around `"Year"` to ensure the output is a DataFrame rather than a Series.

<average>69</average>
