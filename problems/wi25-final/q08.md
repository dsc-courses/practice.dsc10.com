Professor Filius Flitwick is conducting a study whose results will be
used to help new Hogwarts students select appropriately sized
broomsticks for their flying lessons. Professor Flitwick measures
several wizards' heights and broomstick lengths, both in centimeters.
Since broomsticks can only be purchases in specific lengths, the
scatterplot of broomstick length vs. height has a pattern of horizontal
stripes:

If we group the wizards in Professor Flitwick's research study by their
broomstick length, and average the heights of the wizards in each group,
we get the following results.

It turns out that the regression line that predicts broomstick length
($y$) based on wizard height ($x$) passes through the four points
representing the means of each group. For example, the first row of the
DataFrame above means that $(165, 150)$ is a point on the regression
line, as you can see in the scatterplot.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Based only on the fact that the regression line goes through these
points, which of the following *could* represent the relationship
between the standard deviation of broomstick length ($y$) and wizard
height ($x$)? Select all that apply.


[ ] $SD(y) = SD(x)$    
[ ] $SD(y) = 4\cdot SD(x)$
[ ] $SD(y) = 2\cdot SD(x)$   
[ ] $SD(y) = 5\cdot SD(x)$
[ ] $SD(y) = 3\cdot SD(x)$

Now suppose you know that $SD(y) = 3.5 \cdot SD(x)$. What is the
correlation coefficient, $r$, between these variables? Give your answer
as a **simplified fraction**.

Suppose we convert **all wizard heights** from centimeters to inches (1
inch = 2.54 cm). Which of the following will change? Select all that
apply.

[ ] The standard deviation of wizard heights.
[ ] The proportion of wizard heights within three standard deviations of the mean.
[ ] The correlation between wizard height and broom length.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting broom length from wizard height.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting wizard height from broom length.
[ ] None of the above.

Suppose we convert **all wizard heights and all broomstick lengths**
from centimeters to inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm). Which of the following
will change, as compared to the original data when both variables were
measured in centimeters? Select all that apply.

[ ] The correlation between wizard height and broom length.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting broom length from wizard height.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting wizard height from broom length.
[ ] None of the above.

Professor Flitwick calculates the root mean square error (RMSE) for his
regression line to be **36 cm**. What does this RMSE value suggest about
the accuracy of the regression line's broomstick length predictions?

( ) The predictions are, on average, $6$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) The predictions are, on average, $36$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) The predictions are, on average, $(36)^2$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) Every wizard's broomstick length differs from the predicted length by $36$ cm.
( ) The predictions are more accurate for shorter wizards than taller wizards.
( ) The RMSE does not tell us anything about prediction accuracy.
( ) None of the above.
