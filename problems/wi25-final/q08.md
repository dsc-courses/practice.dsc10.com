Professor Filius Flitwick is conducting a study whose results will be
used to help new Hogwarts students select appropriately sized
broomsticks for their flying lessons. Professor Flitwick measures
several wizards' heights and broomstick lengths, both in centimeters.
Since broomsticks can only be purchases in specific lengths, the
scatterplot of broomstick length vs. height has a pattern of horizontal
stripes:

If we group the wizards in Professor Flitwick's research study by their
broomstick length, and average the heights of the wizards in each group,
we get the following results.

It turns out that the regression line that predicts broomstick length
($y$) based on wizard height ($x$) passes through the four points
representing the means of each group. For example, the first row of the
DataFrame above means that $(165, 150)$ is a point on the regression
line, as you can see in the scatterplot.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Based only on the fact that the regression line goes through these
points, which of the following *could* represent the relationship
between the standard deviation of broomstick length ($y$) and wizard
height ($x$)? Select all that apply.

[ ] $SD(y) = SD(x)$    
[ ] $SD(y) = 2\cdot SD(x)$   
[ ] $SD(y) = 3\cdot SD(x)$  
[ ] $SD(y) = 4\cdot SD(x)$
[ ] $SD(y) = 5\cdot SD(x)$


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Options 4 and 5.

To solve this problem, we use the relationship between the slope of the regression line, the correlation coefficient $r$, and the standard deviations:

$$
\text{slope} = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(y)}{\text{SD}(x)}
$$

From the mean points given, we can calculate the slope:

$$
\frac{225 - 150}{187.5 - 165.0} = \frac{75}{22.5} = \frac{10}{3}
$$

We set up the equation:

$$
r \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(y)}{\text{SD}(x)} = \frac{10}{3}
$$

Now consider each option:

- If $\text{SD}(y) = \text{SD}(x)$:
  $$
  r = \frac{10}{3} \text{(not valid, since } r > 1\text{)}
  $$

- If $\text{SD}(y) = 2 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$:
  $$
  r \cdot 2 = \frac{10}{3} \Rightarrow r = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \quad \text{(not valid, since } r > 1\text{)}
  $$
  
- If $\text{SD}(y) = 3 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$:
  $$
  r \cdot 3 = \frac{10}{3} \Rightarrow r = \frac{10}{9} \approx 1.11 \quad \text{(not valid, since } r > 1\text{)}
  $$
  
- If $\text{SD}(y) = 4 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$:
  $$
  r \cdot 4 = \frac{10}{3} \Rightarrow r = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833 \quad \text{(valid)}
  $$
  
- If $\text{SD}(y) = 5 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$:
  $$
  r \cdot 5 = \frac{10}{3} \Rightarrow r = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667 \quad \text{(valid)}
  $$

Therefore, $\text{SD}(y) = 4 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$ and $\text{SD}(y) = 5 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$ are the only valid options.

Now suppose you know that $SD(y) = 3.5 \cdot SD(x)$. What is the
correlation coefficient, $r$, between these variables? Give your answer
as a **simplified fraction**.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: $\frac{20}{21}$

We use the formula for slope:

$$
\text{slope} = r \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(y)}{\text{SD}(x)}
$$

From the mean points given, we can calculate the slope:

$$
\frac{225 - 150}{187.5 - 165.0} = \frac{75}{22.5} = \frac{10}{3}
$$

Since $\text{SD}(y) = 3.5 \cdot \text{SD}(x)$, we plug this into the slope formula:

$$
r \cdot 3.5 = \frac{10}{3}
$$

Solving for $r$:

$$
\begin{align*}
r &= \frac{10}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3.5} \\
&= \frac{10}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{7} \\
&= \frac{20}{21}
\end{align*}
$$

Suppose we convert **all wizard heights** from centimeters to inches (1
inch = 2.54 cm). Which of the following will change? Select all that
apply.

[ ] The standard deviation of wizard heights.
[ ] The proportion of wizard heights within three standard deviations of the mean.
[ ] The correlation between wizard height and broom length.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting broom length from wizard height.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting wizard height from broom length.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Options 1, 4. and 5.

- **Standard deviation of wizard heights** will change because heights are rescaled by a factor of 1/2.54.
- **Proportion within 3 standard deviations** does NOT change since z-scores are unitless and the transformation is linear.
- **Correlation** remains unchanged since it's a unitless measure of linear relationship.
- **Slope predicting broom length from height** will change because the x-variable (height) is rescaled while y remains the same.
- **Slope predicting height from broom length** will change because the output is now in different units.

Suppose we convert **all wizard heights and all broomstick lengths**
from centimeters to inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm). Which of the following
will change, as compared to the original data when both variables were
measured in centimeters? Select all that apply.

[ ] The correlation between wizard height and broom length.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting broom length from wizard height.
[ ] The slope of the regression line predicting wizard height from broom length.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: None of the above

- **Correlation** remains the same because it's unitless.
- Both **slopes** are unchanged because both SD(y) and SD(x) are rescaled by the same factor (1/2.54), so the ratio SD(y)/SD(x) stays the same. When both variables are converted by the same factor, their relative relationship remains unchanged.

Professor Flitwick calculates the root mean square error (RMSE) for his
regression line to be **36 cm**. What does this RMSE value suggest about
the accuracy of the regression line's broomstick length predictions?

( ) The predictions are, on average, $6$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) The predictions are, on average, $36$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) The predictions are, on average, $(36)^2$ cm off from the actual broomstick lengths.
( ) Every wizard's broomstick length differs from the predicted length by $36$ cm.
( ) The predictions are more accurate for shorter wizards than taller wizards.
( ) The RMSE does not tell us anything about prediction accuracy.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: None of the above

RMSE is the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. None of the options accurately describes what RMSE represents because:

- It's not the average absolute error (which would be MAE, not RMSE)
- It doesn't mean every residual equals 36 cm
- It doesn't tell us that predictions vary by wizard height
- It does provide information about prediction accuracy, but not in the ways described

RMSE gives us the typical size of the error in the same units as the response variable. It tells us that the typical prediction error is around 36 cm, but this is not the same as any of the given options.

Which of the following plots is the residual plot for Professor
Flitwick's data?

( ) Option A: <img src='../assets/images/wi25-final/optiona.png' width=400>
( ) Option B: <img src='../assets/images/wi25-final/optionb.png' width=400>
( ) Option C: <img src='../assets/images/wi25-final/optionc.png' width=400>

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer**: Option B

A residual plot shows the difference between actual and predicted values plotted against the predictor variable (x).

Since broomsticks come in specific sizes (150, 175, 200, 225 cm), the residuals will form horizontal bands at each height level.

- **Option A** shows diagonal bands that don't match the horizontal pattern we expect from the broomstick lengths.
- **Option B** shows diagonal bands of residuals that trend downward as height increases. This pattern matches what we would expect given the broomstick lengths and indicates some under/over-prediction at different height values.
- **Option C** shows vertical columns of fairly random residuals, which doesn't capture the relationship between residuals and height we would expect.
