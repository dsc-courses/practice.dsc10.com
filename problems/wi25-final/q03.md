# BEGIN PROB

When new students arrive
at Hogwarts, they get assigned to one of the four houses (Gryffindor,
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin) by a magical Sorting Hat.

Throughout this problem, we'll assume that the Sorting Hat assigns
students to houses uniformly at random, meaning that each student has an
independent 25% chance of winding up in each of the four houses.

For all parts, give your answer as an **unsimplified mathematical
expression**.
