When new students arrive
at Hogwarts, they get assigned to one of the four houses (Gryffindor,
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin) by a magical Sorting Hat.

Throughout this problem, we'll assume that the Sorting Hat assigns
students to houses uniformly at random, meaning that each student has an
independent 25% chance of winding up in each of the four houses.

For all parts, give your answer as an **unsimplified mathematical
expression**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

There are seven siblings in the Weasley family: Bill, Charlie, Percy,
Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny. What is the probability that all seven of
them are assigned to Gryffindor?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left(0.25\right)^{7}$

The probability that a student gets assigned to Gryffindor is 0.25 (or $\frac{1}{4}$). Since we are given that the Sorting Hat assigns students independently, we can apply the multiplication rule and multiply the probability of each of the seven Weasleys being sorted to Gryffindor together. Therefore, all terms in our product are 0.25. Thus, the probability that all seven Weasleys get assigned to Gryffindor would be $0.25 * 0.25 * \ldots * 0.25 = \left(0.25\right)^{7}$.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that Fred and George Weasley are assigned to the
same house?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** 0.25

Fred and George are assigned to the same house if both are in Gryffindor, or both are in Hufflepuff, etc.. Fred and George's selections from the sorting hat are independent. Using the multiplication rule, $P(both in Gryffindor) = 0.25 * 0.25$. Likewise, $P(both in Hufflepuff) = 0.25 * 0.25$. It is the same for Ravenclaw and Slytherin as well. Therefore, $P(same house) = 4 * (0.25 * 0.25) = 0.25$.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the probability that none of the seven Weasley siblings are
assigned to Slytherin?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $\left(0.75\right)^{7}$

The probability that none of the seven Weasley siblings are assigned to Slytherin is equal to the probability that all of the Weasley siblings are not assigned to Slytherin. The probability that someone is not assigned to Slytherin is $1 - P(Slytherin) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$. Since we are given that the Sorting Hat assigns students independently, we can apply the multiplication rule and multiply the probability of each of the seven Weasleys being sorted to anywhere but Slytherin together. Therefore, all terms in our product are 0.75. Thus, the probability that none of seven Weasleys get assigned to Slytherin would be $0.75 * 0.75 * \ldots * 0.75 = \left(0.75\right)^{7}$.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose you are told that none of the seven Weasley siblings are assigned
to Slytherin. Based on this information, what is the probability that at
least one of the siblings is assigned to Gryffindor?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** $1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{7}$

Since we are given that none of the Weasley siblings are assigned to Slytherin, our possibilities are now only Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Therefore, the probability that someone is assigned to Gryffindor would become $\frac{1}{3}$. Correspondingly, the probability that someone isn't assigned to Gryffindor is $1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.
The probability that at least one of the siblings is assigned to Gryffindor is equal to 1 - the probability that none of the siblings are assigned to Gryffindor, or $1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{7}$.
