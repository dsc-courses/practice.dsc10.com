The DataFrame `ten_txns`, **displayed in its entirety below**, contains
a simple random sample of 10 rows from `txn`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select one transaction from `ten_txns`. What is the
probability that the selected transaction is made with a `"card"` of
`"mastercard"` or a `"method"` of `"debit"`? Give your answer either as
an exact decimal or a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 0.7

We can simply count the number of transactions meeting at least one of the two criteria. More easily, there are only 3 rows that do not meet either of the criteria (the rows that are `"visa"` and `"credit"` transactions). Therefore, the probability is 7 out of 10, or 0.7. Note that we cannot simply add up the probability of `"mastercard"` (0.3) and the probability of `"debit"` (0.6) since there is overlap between these. That is, some transactions are both `"mastercard"` and `"debit"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select two transactions from `"ten_txns"`, without
replacement, and learn that neither of the selected transactions is for
an amount of 100 dollars. Given this information, what is the
probability that:

-   the first transaction is made with a `"card"` of `"visa"` and a
    `"method"` of `"debit"`, and

-   the second transaction is made with a `"card"` of `"visa"` and a
    `"method"` of `"credit"`?

Give your answer either as an exact decimal or a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{2}{15}$

We know that the sample space here doesn’t have any of the \$100 transactions, so we can ignore the first 4 rows when calculating the probability. In the remaining 6 rows, there are exactly 2 debit transactions with `"visa"` cards, so the probability of our first transaction being of the specified type is $\frac{2}{6}$. There are also two credit transactions with `"visa"` cards, but the denominator of the probability of the second transaction is 5 (not 6), since the sample space was reduced by one after the first transaction. We’re choosing without replacement, so you can’t have the same transaction in your sample twice. Thus, the probability of the second transaction being a visa credit card is $\frac{2}{5}$. Now, we can apply the multiplication rule, and we have that the probability of both transactions being as described is $\frac{2}{6} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{30} = \frac{2}{15}$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select 15 rows, with replacement, from `ten_txns`.
What's the probability that in our selection of 15 rows, the maximum
transaction amount is less than 25 dollars?

( ) $\frac{3}{10}$
( ) $\frac{3}{15}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{3}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{15}\right)^{3}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{10}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{15}\right)^{10}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{15}$
( ) $\left(\frac{3}{15}\right)^{15}$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{15}$

There are only 3 rows in the sample with a transaction amount under \$25, so the chance of choosing one transaction with such a low value is $\frac{3}{10}$. For the maximum transaction amount to be less than 25 dollars, this means all transaction amounts in our sample have to be less than 25 dollars. To find the chance that all transactions are for less than \$25, we can apply the multiplication rule and multiply the probability of each of the 15 transactions being less than \$25. Since we’re choosing 15 times with replacement, the events are independent (choosing a certain transaction on the first try won’t affect the probability of choosing it again later), so all the terms in our product are $\frac{3}{10}$. Thus, the probability is $\frac{3}{10} * \frac{3}{10} * \ldots * \frac{3}{10} = \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{15}$.
