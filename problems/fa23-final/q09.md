# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select one transaction from `ten_txns`. What is the
probability that the selected transaction is made with a `"card"` of
`"mastercard"` or a `"method"` of `"debit"`? Give your answer either as
an exact decimal or a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select two transactions from `"ten_txns"`, without
replacement, and learn that neither of the selected transactions is for
an amount of 100 dollars. Given this information, what is the
probability that:

-   the first transaction is made with a `"card"` of `"visa"` and a
    `"method"` of `"debit"`, and

-   the second transaction is made with a `"card"` of `"visa"` and a
    `"method"` of `"credit"`?

Give your answer either as an exact decimal or a simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose we randomly select 15 rows, with replacement, from `ten_txns`.
What's the probability that in our selection of 15 rows, the maximum
transaction amount is less than 25 dollars?
