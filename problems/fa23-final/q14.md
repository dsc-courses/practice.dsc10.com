As mentioned in the previous problem, Ashley has sample of 400 rows of
`txn`. Coincidentally, in Ashley's sample of 400 transactions, the mean
and standard deviation of the `"amount"` column both come out to 70
dollars.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank:

::: center
"According to Chebyshev's inequality, at most 25 transactions in
Ashley's sample\
are above \_\_\_\_ dollars; the rest must be below \_\_\_\_ dollars.\"
:::

What goes in the blank? Give your answer as an **integer**. Both blanks
are filled in with the same number.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 350

Chebyshev’s inequality says something about how much data falls within a given number of standard deviations. The data that doesn’t fall in that range could be entirely below that range, entirely above that range, or split some below and some above. So the idea is that we should figure out the endpoints of the range for which Chebyshev guarantees that at least 375 transactions must fall. Then at most 25 might fall above that range. So we’ll fill in the blank with the upper limit of that range. Now, since there are 400 transactions, 375 as a proportion becomes $\frac{375}{400} = \frac{15}{16}$. That’s $1 - \frac{1}{16}$ or $1 - \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2$, so we should use $z=4$ in the statement of Chebyshev’s inequality. That is, $\frac{15}{16}$ proportion of the data falls within 4 standard deviations of the mean. The upper endpoint of that range is $70$ (the mean) plus $4 \cdot 70$ (four standard deviations), or $5 \cdot 70 = 350$.

Now, we're given that the mean and standard deviation of the
`"lifetime"` column in Ashley's sample are both equal to $c$ dollars.
We're also given that the correlation between transaction amounts and
lifetime spending in Ashley's sample is $-\frac{1}{4}$.

Which of the four options could be a scatter plot of lifetime spending
vs. transaction amount?

( ) Option A
( ) Option B
( ) Option C
( ) Option D

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Option B

 Here, the main factor which we can use to identify the correct plot is the correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient of $-\frac{1}{4}$ indicates that the data will have a slight downward trend (values on the y axis will be lower as we go further right). This narrows it down to option A or option B, but option A appears to have too strong of a linear trend. We want the data to look more like a cloud than a line since the correlation is relatively close to zero, which suggests that option B is the more viable choice.

Ashley decides to use linear regression to predict the lifetime spending
of a card given a transaction amount.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The predicted lifetime spending, in **dollars**, of a card with a
transaction amount of 280 dollars is of the form $f \cdot c$, where $f$
is a fraction. What is the value of $f$? Give your answer as a
simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $f = \frac{1}{4}$

This problem requires us to make a prediction using the regression line for a given $x = 280$. We can solve this problem using original units or standard units. Since 280 is a multiple of 70, and the mean and standard deviation are both 70, it’s pretty straightforward to convert 280 to 3 standard units, as $\frac{(280-70)}{70} = \frac{210}{70} = 3$. To make a prediction in standard units, all we need to do is multiply by $r=-\frac{1}{4}$, resulting in a predicted lifetime spending of $=-\frac{3}{4}$ in standard units. Since we are told in the previous subpart that both the mean and standard deviation of lifetime spending are $c$ dollars, then converting to original units gives $c + -\frac{3}{4} \cdot c = \frac{1}{4} \cdot c$, so $f = \frac{1}{4}$.

Suppose the intercept of the regression line, when both transaction
amounts and lifetime spending are measured in **dollars**, is 40. What
is the value of $c$? Give your answer as an integer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $c = 32$

 We start with the formulas for the mean and intercept of the regression line, then set the mean and SD of x both to 70, and the mean and SD of y both to c, as well as the intercept b to 40. Then we can solve for c.

\begin{align*}

m &= r \cdot \frac{\text{SD of } y}{\text{SD of }x} \\
b &= \text{mean of } y - m \cdot \text{mean of } x \\
m &= -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{c}{70} \\
40 &= c - (-\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{c}{70}) \cdot 70 \\
40 &= c + \frac{1}{4} c \\
40 &= \frac{5}{4} c \\
c &= 40 \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\
c &= 32

\end{align*}
