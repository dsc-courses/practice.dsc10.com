As mentioned in the previous problem, Ashley has sample of 400 rows of
`txn`. Coincidentally, in Ashley's sample of 400 transactions, the mean
and standard deviation of the `"amount"` column both come out to 70
dollars.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blank:

::: center
"According to Chebyshev's inequality, at most 25 transactions in
Ashley's sample\
are above \_\_\_\_ dollars; the rest must be below \_\_\_\_ dollars.\"
:::

What goes in the blank? Give your answer as an **integer**. Both blanks
are filled in with the same number.

Now, we're given that the mean and standard deviation of the
`"lifetime"` column in Ashley's sample are both equal to $c$ dollars.
We're also given that the correlation between transaction amounts and
lifetime spending in Ashley's sample is $-\frac{1}{4}$.

Which of the four options could be a scatter plot of lifetime spending
vs. transaction amount?

Ashley decides to use linear regression to predict the lifetime spending
of a card given a transaction amount.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The predicted lifetime spending, in **dollars**, of a card with a
transaction amount of 280 dollars is of the form $f \cdot c$, where $f$
is a fraction. What is the value of $f$? Give your answer as a
simplified fraction.

Suppose the intercept of the regression line, when both transaction
amounts and lifetime spending are measured in **dollars**, is 40. What
is the value of $c$? Give your answer as an integer.
