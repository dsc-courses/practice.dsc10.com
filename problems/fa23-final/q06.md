Aaron wants to explore the discrepancy in fraud rates between
`"discover"` transactions and `"mastercard"` transactions. To do so, he
creates the DataFrame `ds_mc`, which only contains the rows in `txn`
corresponding to `"mastercard"` or `"discover"` transactions.

After he creates `ds_mc`, Aaron groups `ds_mc` on the `"card"` column
using two different aggregation methods. The relevant columns in the
resulting DataFrames are shown below.

Aaron decides to perform a test of the following pair of hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"`
    transactions is **the same as** the proportion of fraudulent
    `"discover"` transactions.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent
    `"mastercard"` transactions is **less than** the proportion of
    fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.

As his test statistic, Aaron chooses the **difference in proportion of
transactions that are fraudulent**, in the order `"mastercard"` minus
`"discover"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type of statistical test is Aaron performing?

( ) Standard hypothesis test 
( ) Permutation test

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the value of the observed statistic? Give your answer either as
an exact decimal or simplified fraction.

observed statistic = `___`

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$\frac{4000}{40000} - \frac{160}{2000} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{8}{100} = 0.1 - 0.08 = 0.02$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

The empirical distribution of Aaron's chosen test statistic is shown
below.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following is closest to the p-value of Aaron's test?

( ) 0.001
( ) 0.37
( ) 0.63
( ) 0.94
( ) 0.999

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the conclusion of Aaron's test?

( ) The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions is **less
than** the\
proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.
( ) The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions is
**greater than** the\
proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.
( ) The test results are inconclusive.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Aaron now decides to test a slightly different pair of hypotheses.

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"`
    transactions is **the same as** the proportion of fraudulent
    `"discover"` transactions.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent
    `"mastercard"` transactions is **greater than** the proportion of
    fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.

He uses the same test statistic as before.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following is closest to the p-value of Aaron's new test?

( ) 0.001
( ) 0.06
( ) 0.37
( ) 0.63
( ) 0.94
( ) 0.999
