Aaron wants to explore the discrepancy in fraud rates between
`"discover"` transactions and `"mastercard"` transactions. To do so, he
creates the DataFrame `ds_mc`, which only contains the rows in `txn`
corresponding to `"mastercard"` or `"discover"` transactions.

After he creates `ds_mc`, Aaron groups `ds_mc` on the `"card"` column
using two different aggregation methods. The relevant columns in the
resulting DataFrames are shown below.

Aaron decides to perform a test of the following pair of hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"`
    transactions is **the same as** the proportion of fraudulent
    `"discover"` transactions.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent
    `"mastercard"` transactions is **less than** the proportion of
    fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.

As his test statistic, Aaron chooses the **difference in proportion of
transactions that are fraudulent**, in the order `"mastercard"` minus
`"discover"`.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type of statistical test is Aaron performing?

( ) Standard hypothesis test 
( ) Permutation test

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Permutation test

Permutation tests are used to ascertain whether two samples were drawn from the same population. Hypothesis testing is used when we have a single sample and a known population, and want to determine whether the sample appears to have been drawn from that population. Here, we have two samples (`“mastercard”` and `“discover”`) and no known population distribution, so a permutation test is the appropriate test.

What is the value of the observed statistic? Give your answer either as
an exact decimal or simplified fraction.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $0.02$

We simply take the difference in fraudulent proportion of `"mastercard"` transactions and fraudulent proportion of discover transactions. There are 4,000 fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions and 40,000 total `"mastercard"` transactions, making this proportion \frac{4000}{40000} for `"mastercard"`. Similarly, the proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions is $\frac{160}{2000}$. Simplifying these fractions, the difference between them is $\frac{1}{10} - \frac{8}{100} = 0.1 - 0.08 = 0.02$.

Which of the following is closest to the p-value of Aaron's test?

( ) 0.001
( ) 0.37
( ) 0.63
( ) 0.94
( ) 0.999

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 0.999

 Informally, the p-value is the area of the histogram at or past the observed statistic, further in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. In this case, the alternative hypothesis is that the `"mastercard"` proportion is less than the discover proportion, and our test statistic is computed in the order `"mastercard"` minus `"discover"`, so low (negative) values correspond to the alternative. This means when calculating the p-value, we look at the area to the left of 0.02 (the observed value). We see that essentially all of the test statistics fall to the left of this value, so the p-value should be closest to 0.999.

<average>54</average>

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the conclusion of Aaron's test?

( ) The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions is **less than** the proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.
( ) The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions is **greater than** the proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.
( ) The test results are inconclusive.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** None of the above

- Option A: Since the p-value was so high, it’s unlikely that the proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"` transactions is less than the proportion of fraudulent `"discover"` transactions, so we cannot conclude A.
- Option B: The test does not allow us to conclude this, because it was not one of the hypotheses. All we can say is that we don’t think the alternative hypothesis is true - we can’t say whether any other statement is true.
- Option C: The test did give us valuable information about the difference in fraud rates: we failed to reject the null hypothesis. So, the test is conclusive, making option C incorrect. Therefore, option D (none of the above) is correct.

<average>44</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

Aaron now decides to test a slightly different pair of hypotheses.

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent `"mastercard"`
    transactions is **the same as** the proportion of fraudulent
    `"discover"` transactions.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of fraudulent
    `"mastercard"` transactions is **greater than** the proportion of
    fraudulent `"discover"` transactions.

He uses the same test statistic as before.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following is closest to the p-value of Aaron's new test?

( ) 0.001
( ) 0.06
( ) 0.37
( ) 0.63
( ) 0.94
( ) 0.999

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 0.001

Now, we have switched the alternative hypothesis to “ `"mastercard"` fraud rate is greater than `"discover"` fraud rate”, whereas before our alternative hypothesis was that the `"mastercard"` fraud rate was less than `"discover"`'s fraud rate. We have not changed the way we calculate the test statistic (`"mastercard"` minus `"discover"`), so now large values of the test statistic correspond to the alternative hypothesis. So, the area of interest is the area to the right of 0.02, which is very small, close to 0.001. Note that this is one minus the p-value we computed before.
