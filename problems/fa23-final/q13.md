Ashley doesn't have access to the entire `txn` DataFrame; instead, she
has access to a simple random sample of **400** rows of `txn`.

She draws two histograms, each of which depicts the distribution of the
`"amount"` column in her sample, using different bins.

Unfortunately, DataHub is being finicky and so two of the bars in
Histogram A are deleted after it is created.

In Histogram A, which of the following bins contains approximately 60
transactions?

( ) $[30, 60)$
( ) $[90, 120)$
( ) $[120, 150)$
( ) $[180, 210)$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $[90, 120)$

The number of transactions contained in the bin is given by the area of the bin times the total number of transactions, since the area of a bin represents the proportion of transactions that are contained in that bin. We are asked which bin contains about 60 transactions, or $\frac{60}{400} = \frac{3}{20} = 0.15$ proportion of the total area. All the bins in Histogram A have a width of 30, so for the area to be 0.15, we need the height $h$ to satisfy $h\cdot 30 = 0.15$. This means $h = \frac{0.15}{30} = 0.005$. The bin $[90, 120)$ is closest to this height.

Let $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the heights of bars $W$, $X$, $Y$, and
$Z$, respectively. For instance, $y$ is about 0.01.

Which of the following expressions gives the height of the bar
corresponding to the $[60, 90)$ bin in Histogram A?

( ) $( y + z ) - ( w + x )$
( ) $( w + x ) - ( y + z )$
( ) $\frac{3}{2}( y + z ) - ( w + x )$
( ) $( y + z ) - \frac{3}{2}( w + x )$
( ) $3( y + z ) - 2( w + x )$
( ) $2( y + z ) - 3( w + x )$
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** $\frac{3}{2}( y + z ) - ( w + x )$

The idea is that the first three bars  in Histogram A represent the same set of transactions as the first three bars of Histogram B. Setting these areas equals gives $30w+30x+30u= 45y+45z$, where $u$ is the unknown height of the bar corresponding to the $[60, 90)$ bin. Solving this equation for $u$ gives the result.

\begin{align*}
30w+30x+30u &= 45y+45z \\
30u &= 45y+45z-30w-30x \\
u &= \frac{45y + 45z - 30w - 30x}{30} \\
u &= \frac{3}{2}(y+z) - (w+x)

\end{align*}

<average>50</average>
