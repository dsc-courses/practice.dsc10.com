Ashley doesn't have access to the entire `txn` DataFrame; instead, she
has access to a simple random sample of **400** rows of `txn`.

She draws two histograms, each of which depicts the distribution of the
`"amount"` column in her sample, using different bins.

Unfortunately, DataHub is being finicky and so two of the bars in
Histogram A are deleted after it is created.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

In Histogram A, which of the following bins contains approximately 60
transactions?

( ) $[30, 60)$
( ) $[90, 120)$
( ) $[120, 150)$
( ) $[180, 210)$

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 

The number of transactions contained in the bin is given by the area of the bin times the total number of transactions, since the area of a bin represents the proportion of transactions that are contained in that bin. For brevity, Iâ€™ll only include the calculation for the correct bin, `[90, 120)`: The proportion contained in this bin is given by $(120-90) * 0.005 = 0.15$. Now, to translate this proportion into a count, we simply multiply by the total number of transactions: $0.15 * 400 = 60$.

Let $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the heights of bars $W$, $X$, $Y$, and
$Z$, respectively. For instance, $y$ is about 0.01.

Which of the following expressions gives the height of the bar
corresponding to the $[60, 90)$ bin in Histogram A?

( ) $( y + z ) - ( w + x )$
( ) $( w + x ) - ( y + z )$
( ) $\frac{3}{2}( y + z ) - ( w + x )$
( ) $( y + z ) - \frac{3}{2}( w + x )$
( ) $3( y + z ) - 2( w + x )$
( ) $2( y + z ) - 3( w + x )$
( ) None of the above.
