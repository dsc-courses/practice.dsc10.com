Given a subset of data from a fraud
detection dataset, you are to perform a permutation test to determine if
the average transaction amount is significantly different for fraudulent
versus non-fraudulent transactions. The dataset provided for this test
contains 6 transactions. The `"is_fraud"` labels have been hidden for
the purpose of this test, but you are informed that out of these 6
transactions, 4 are non-fraudulent, and 2 are fraudulent.

Your goal is to use permutation testing to assess whether the mean
transaction_amt for fraudulent transactions is significantly larger than
for non-fraudulent ones.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Define the test statistic that would appropriately measure the
difference in the average transaction_amt between the fraudulent and
non-fraudulent transactions. Justify your choice of statistic.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

Outline the steps for conducting the permutation test using the test
statistic you have defined. Detail how you would assign 'is_fraud'
labels for each permutation and compute the test statistic each time.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

Describe how you would use the distribution of the test statistic from
the permutation samples to decide whether there is a statistically
significant difference in the mean transaction_amts. Specify if you
would use a one-tailed or two-tailed test at the 0.05 significance
level, and interpret a hypothetical result.
