Jason is interested in exploring the relationship between the browser
and payment method used for a transaction. To do so, he uses `txn` to
create create three tables, each of which contain the distribution of
browsers used for credit card transactions and the distribution of
browsers used for debit card transactions, but with different
combinations of browsers combined in a single category in each table.

Jason calculates the total variation distance (TVD) between the two
distributions in each of his three tables, but he does not record which
TVD goes with which table. He computed TVDs of 0.14, 0.36, and 0.38.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
In which table do the two distributions have a TVD of 0.14?

( ) Table 1
( ) Table 2
( ) Table 3

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** Table 3

Without values in any of the tables, there’s no way to do this problem computationally. We are told that the three TVDs come out to 0.14, 0.36, and 0.38. The exact numbers are not important but their relative order is. The key to this problem is noticing that when we combine two categories into one, the TVD can only decrease, it cannot increase. One way to see this is to think about combining categories repeatedly until there’s just one category. Then both distributions must have a value of 1 in that category so they are identical distributions with the smallest possible TVD of 0. As we collapse categories, we can only decrease the TVD. This tells us that Table 1 has the largest TVD, then Table 2 has the middle TVD, and Table 3 has the smallest, since each time we are combining categories and shrinking the TVD.
