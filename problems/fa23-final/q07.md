Jason is interested in exploring the relationship between the browser
and payment method used for a transaction. To do so, he uses `txn` to
create create three tables, each of which contain the distribution of
browsers used for credit card transactions and the distribution of
browsers used for debit card transactions, but with different
combinations of browsers combined in a single category in each table.

  **Browser**    **Credit**   **Debit**
  ------------- ------------ -----------
  Chrome             ?            ?
  Safari             ?            ?
  Firefox            ?            ?
  Edge               ?            ?

**Table 1**

  **Browser**          **Credit**   **Debit**
  ------------------- ------------ -----------

**Table 2**

  **Browser**                 **Credit**   **Debit**
  -------------------------- ------------ -----------
  Chrome                          ?            ?
  Safari, Firefox, or Edge        ?            ?
  Other                           ?            ?

**Table 3**

Jason calculates the total variation distance (TVD) between the two
distributions in each of his three tables, but he does not record which
TVD goes with which table. He computed TVDs of 0.14, 0.36, and 0.38.
