# BEGIN PROB

Consider the DataFrame `combo`, defined below.

```py  
    combo = txn.groupby(["is_fraud", "method", "card"]).mean()
```

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What is the maximum possible value of `combo.shape[0]`? Give your answer
as an integer.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 16

`combo.shape[0]` will give us the number of rows of the `combo` DataFrame. Since we’re grouping by `"is_fraud"`, `"method"`, and `"card"`, we will have one row for each unique combination of values in these columns. There are 2 possible values for `"is_fraud"`, 2 possible values for `"method"`, and 2 possible values for `"card"`, so the total number of possibilities is 2 * 2 * 4 = 16. This is the maximum number possible because 16 combinations of `"is_fraud"`, `"method"`, and `"card"` are possible, but they may not all exist in the data.

What is the value of `combo.shape[1]`?

( ) 1
( ) 2
( ) 3
( ) 4
( ) 5
( ) 6

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** 2

`combo.shape[1]` will give us the number of columns of the DataFrame. In this case, we’re using `.mean()` as our aggregation function, so the resulting DataFrame will only have columns with numeric types (since BabyPandas automatically ignores columns which have a data type incompatible with the aggregation function). In this case, `"amount"` and `"lifetime"` are the only numeric columns, so `combo` will have 2 columns.
