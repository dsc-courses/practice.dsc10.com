The following code block produces a bar chart, which is shown directly
beneath it.

    (txn.groupby("browser").mean()
        .sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=False)
        .take(np.arange(10))
        .plot(kind="barh", y="is_fraud"));

Based on the above bar chart, what can we conclude about the browser
`"icedragon"`? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] In our dataset, `"icedragon"` is the most frequently used browser
among all trans-\
actions.
[ ] In our dataset, `"icedragon"` is the most frequently used browser
among fraudulent\
transactions.
[ ] In our dataset, every transaction made with `"icedragon"` is
fraudulent.
[ ] In our dataset, there are more fraudulent transactions made with
`"icedragon"` than\
with any other browser.
[ ] None of the above.

How can we modify the provided code block so that the bar chart displays
the same information, but with the bars sorted in the opposite order
(i.e. with the longest bar at the top)?

( ) Change `ascending=False` to `ascending=True`.
( ) Add `.sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=True)` immediately
before\
`.take(np.arange(10))`.
( ) Add `.sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=True)` immediately after\
`.take(np.arange(10))`.
( ) None of the above.
