The following code block produces a bar chart, which is shown directly
beneath it.

```py  
    (txn.groupby("browser").mean()
        .sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=False)
        .take(np.arange(10))
        .plot(kind="barh", y="is_fraud"))
```

Based on the above bar chart, what can we conclude about the browser
`"icedragon"`? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] In our dataset, `"icedragon"` is the most frequently used browser among all transactions.
[ ] In our dataset, `"icedragon"` is the most frequently used browser among fraudulent transactions.
[ ] In our dataset, every transaction made with `"icedragon"` is fraudulent.
[ ] In our dataset, there are more fraudulent transactions made with `"icedragon"` than with any other browser.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** C

First, let’s take a look at what the code is doing. We start by grouping by browser and taking the mean, so each column will have the average value of that column for each browser (where each browser is a row). We then sort in descending order by the `"is_fraud"` column, so the browser which has the highest proportion of fraudulent transactions will be first, and we take first the ten browsers, or those with the most fraud. Finally, we plot the `"is_fraud"` column in a horizontal bar chart. So, our plot shows the proportion of fraudulent transactions for each browser, and we see that `icedragon` has a proportion of 1.0, implying that every transaction is fraudulent. This makes the third option correct. Since we don’t have enough information to conclude any of the other options, the third option is the only correct one.

<average>83</average>

How can we modify the provided code block so that the bar chart displays
the same information, but with the bars sorted in the opposite order
(i.e. with the longest bar at the top)?

( ) Change `ascending=False` to `ascending=True`.
( ) Add `.sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=True)` immediately before `.take(np.arange(10))`.
( ) Add `.sort_values(by="is_fraud", ascending=True)` immediately after `.take(np.arange(10))`.
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer:** C

Let’s analyze each option
A: This isn’t correct, because we must remember that `np.take(np.arange(10))` takes the rows indexed 0 through 10. And if we change `ascending = False` to `ascending = True`, the rows indexed 0 through 10 won’t be the same in the resulting DataFrame (since now they’ll be the 10 browsers with the **lowest** fraud rate).
B: This will have the same effect as option A, since it’s being applied before the `np.take()` operation
C: Once we have the 10 rows with the highest fraud rate, we can sort them in ascending order in order to reverse the order of the bars. Since we already have the 10 rows from the original plot, this option is correct.

<average>59</average>
