On Reddit, Keenan also read that 22% of all online transactions are
fraudulent. He decides to test the following hypotheses at the **0.16
significance level**:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of online transactions that are
    fraudulent is **0.22**.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of online transactions
    that are fraudulent is not **0.22**.

Keenan has access to a simple random sample of `txn` of size **500**. In
his sample, the proportion of transactions that are fraudulent is
**0.23**.

Below is an incomplete implementation of the function `reject_null`,
which creates a bootstrap-based confidence interval and returns **True**
if the conclusion of Keenan's test is to **reject** the null hypothesis,
and **False** if the conclusion is to **fail to reject** the null
hypothesis, all at the **0.16** significance level.

    def reject_null():
        fraud_counts = np.array([])
        for i in np.arange(10000):
            fraud_count = np.random.multinomial(500, __(a)__)[0] 
            fraud_counts = np.append(fraud_counts, fraud_count)
            
        L = np.percentile(fraud_counts, __(b)__)
        R = np.percentile(fraud_counts, __(c)__)

        if __(d)__ < L or __(d)__ > R:
            # Return True if we REJECT the null.
            return True
        else:
            # Return False if we FAIL to reject the null.
            return False

Fill in the blanks so that `reject_null` works as intended.

*Hint: Your answer to (d) should be an integer greater than 50.*
