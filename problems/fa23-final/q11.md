On Reddit, Yutian read that 22% of all online transactions are
fraudulent. She decides to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of online transactions that are
    fraudulent is **0.22**.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The proportion of online transactions
    that are fraudulent is not **0.22**.

To test her hypotheses, she decides to create a **95%** confidence
interval for the proportion of online transactions that are fraudulent
using the Central Limit Theorem.

Unfortunately, she doesn't have access to the entire `txn` DataFrame;
rather, she has access to a simple random sample of `txn` of size $n$.
In her sample, the proportion of transactions that are fraudulent is
**0.2** (or equivalently, $\frac{1}{5}$).

The width of Yutian's confidence interval is of the form
$$\frac{c}{5 \sqrt{n}}$$

where $n$ is the size of her sample and $c$ is some positive integer.
What is the value of $c$? Give your answer as an integer.

*Hint: Use the fact that in a collection of 0s and 1s, if the proportion
of values that are 1 is $p$, the standard deviation of the collection is
$\sqrt{p(1-p)}$.*

$c = `___`$

There is a positive integer $J$ such that:

-   If $n < J$, Yutian will fail to reject her null hypothesis at the
    **0.05** significance level.

-   If $n > J$, Yutian will reject her null hypothesis at the **0.05**
    significance level.

What is the value of $J$? Give your answer as an integer.

$J = `___`$
