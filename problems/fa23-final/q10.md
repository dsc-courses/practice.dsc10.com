As a senior suffering from senioritis, Weiyue has plenty of time on his
hands. 1,000 times, he repeats the following process, creating 1,000
confidence intervals:

1.  Collect a simple random sample of 100 rows from `txn`.

2.  Resample from his sample 10,000 times, computing the mean
    transaction amount in each resample.

3.  Create a 95% confidence interval by taking the middle 95% of
    resample means.

He then computes the width of each confidence interval by subtracting
its left endpoint from its right endpoint; e.g. if $[2, 5]$ is a
confidence interval, its width is 3. This gives him 1,000 widths. Let
$M$ be the mean of these 1,000 widths.

Select the true statement below.

( ) About 950 of Weiyue's intervals will contain the mean transaction
amount of all\
transactions ever.
( ) About 950 of Weiyue's intervals will contain the mean transaction
amount of all\
transactions in `txn`.
( ) About 950 of Weiyue's intervals will contain the mean transaction
amount of all\
transactions in the first random sample of 100 rows of `txn` Weiyue
took.
( ) About 950 of Weiyue's intervals will contain $M$.

Weiyue repeats his entire process, except this time, he changes his
sample size in step 1 from 100 to 400. Let $B$ be the mean of the widths
of the 1,000 new confidence intervals he creates.

What is the relationship between $M$ and $B$?

( ) $M < B$
( ) $M \approx B$
( ) $M > B$

# END SOLUTION

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Weiyue repeats his entire process once again. This time, he still uses a
sample size of 100 in step 1, but instead of creating 95% confidence
intervals in step 3, he creates 99% confidence intervals. Let $C$ be the
mean of the widths of the 1,000 new confidence intervals he generates.

What is the relationship between $M$ and $C$?

( ) $M < C$ 
( ) $M \approx C$ 
( ) $M > C$

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Weiyue repeats his entire process one last time. This time, he still
uses a sample size of 100 in step 1, and creates 95% confidence
intervals in step 3, but instead of bootstrapping, he uses the Central
Limit Theorem to generate his confidence intervals. Let $D$ be the mean
of the widths of the 1,000 new confidence intervals he creates.

What is the relationship between $M$ and $D$?

( ) $M < D$ 
( ) $M \approx D$ 
( ) $M > D$
