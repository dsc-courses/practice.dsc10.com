The DataFrame `seven`, shown below to the **left**, consists of a simple
random sample of 7 rows from `txn`, with just the `"is_fraud"` and
`"amount"` columns selected.

The DataFrame `locations`, shown below to the **right**, is missing some
values in its `"is_fraud"` column.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Fill in the blanks to complete the `"is_fraud"` column of
`locations` so that the DataFrame
`seven.merge(locations, on="is_fraud")` has **19** rows.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer** A correct answer has one `True` and three `False` rows.

We’re merging on the `"is_fraud"` column, so we want to look at which rows have which values for `"is_fraud"`. There are only two possible values (`True` and `False`), and we see that there are two `True`s and 5 `False`s in `seven`. Now, think about what happens “under the hood” for this merge, and how many rows are created when it occurs. Python will match each `True` in `seven` with each `True` in the `"is_fraud"` column of `location`, and make a new row for each such pair. For example, since Toronto’s row in `location` has a `True` value in `location`, the merged DataFrame will have one row where Toronto is matched with the transaction of $34.92 and one where Toronto is matched with the transaction of $25.07. More broadly, each `True` in `locations` creates 2 rows in the merged DataFrame, and each `False` in `locations` creates 5 rows in the merged DataFrame. The question now boils down to creating 19 by summing 2s and 5s. Notice that $19 = 3\cdot5+2\cdot2$. This means we can achieve the desired 19 rows by making sure the `locations` DataFrame has three `False` rows and two `True` rows. Since `location` already has one `True`, we can fill in the remaining spots with three `False`s and one `True`. It doesn’t matter which rows we make `True` and which ones we make `False`, since either way the merge will produce the same number of rows for each (5 each for every `False` and 2 each for every `True`).

True or False: It is possible to fill in the four blanks in the
`"is_fraud"` column of `locations` so that the DataFrame
`seven.merge(locations, on="is_fraud")` has **14** rows.

( ) True 
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION
**Answer:** False

As we discovered by solving problem 5.1, each `False` value in `locations` gives rise to 5 rows of the merged DataFrame, and each `True` value gives rise to 2 rows. This means that the number of rows in the merged DataFrame will be $m\cdot5 + n\cdot2$, where m is the number of Falses in `location` and n is the number of `Trues` in `location`. Namely, m and n are integers that add up to 5. There’s only a few possibilities so we can try them all, and see that none add up 14:

- $0\cdot5 + 5\cdot2 = 10$

- $1\cdot5 + 4\cdot2 = 13$

- $2\cdot5 + 3\cdot2 = 16$

- $3\cdot5 + 2\cdot2 = 19$

- $4\cdot5 + 1\cdot2 = 22$
