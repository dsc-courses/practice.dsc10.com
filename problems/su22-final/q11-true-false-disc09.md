Answer the following true/false questions.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

For a given sample, a 90% confidence interval is narrower than a
95% confidence interval.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

The more narrow an interval is, the less confident one is that the intervals one creates will contain the true population parameter.

<average>91</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB



# BEGIN SUBPROB

The distribution of sample proportions is roughly normal for large samples because of the Central Limit Theorem. 

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

This is just the definition of Central Limit Theorem. Remember that a proportion is a mean of 0s and 1s.

<average>43</average>

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB


# BEGIN SUBPROB

Chebyshev's inequality implies that we can always create at least a 96%
confidence interval from a bootstrap distribution using
the mean of the distribution plus or minus 5 standard deviations.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** True

By Chebyshev's theorem, at least `1 - 1 / z^2` of the data is within `z` STD of the mean. Thus `1 - 1 / 5^2 = 0.96` of the data is within 5 STD of the mean. 

<average>51</average>

# END SUBPROB
