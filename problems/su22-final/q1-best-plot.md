What kinds of dogs cost the most?

( ) Bar plot
( ) Scatter plot
( ) Histogram
( ) None


# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Bar plot

Here, there is a categorical variable (the breed of the dog) and a quantitative variable (the price of the dog). A bar plot is most suitable for this scenario when trying to compare quantitative values accross different categorical values. A scatter plot or histogram wouldn't be appropriate here since both of those charts typically aim to visualize a comparison between two quantitative variables.

Do toy dogs have smaller `'size'` values than other dogs?

( ) Bar plot
( ) Scatter plot
( ) Histogram
( ) None

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** None of the above 

We are comparing two categorical variables (`'size'` and `'kind'`). None of the graphs here are suitable for this scenario since bar plots are used to compare a categorical variable against a quantitative variable, while scatter plots and histograms compare a quantitative variable against quantitative variable.

Is there a linear relationship between weight and height?

( ) Bar plot
( ) Scatter plot
( ) Histogram
( ) None

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Scatter plot 

When looking for a relationship between two continuous quantitative variables, a scatter plot is the most appropriate graph here since the primary use of a scatter plot is to observe the relationship between two numerical variables. A bar chart isn't suitable since we have two quantitative variables, while a bar chart visualizes a quantitative variable and a categorical variable. A histogram isn't suitable since it's typically used to show the frequency of each interval (in other words, the distribution of a numerical variable).

Do dogs that are highly suitable for children weigh more?

( ) Bar plot
( ) Scatter plot
( ) Histogram
( ) None

# BEGIN SOLUTION

**Answer: ** Bar plot 

We're comparing a categorical variable (dog suitability for children) with a quantitative varible (weight). A bar plot is most approriate when comparing a categorical variable against a quantitative variable. Both scatter plot and histogram aim to compare a quantitative variable against another quantitative variable.
