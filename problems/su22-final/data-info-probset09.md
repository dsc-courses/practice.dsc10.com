The American Kennel Club (AKC) organizes information about dog
breeds. We've loaded their dataset into a DataFrame called `df`. The index of
`df` contains the dog breed names as `str` values. Besides other columns, there is a column `'weight' (float)` that contains typical weight (kg) and a column `'height' (float)` that contains typical height (cm).
